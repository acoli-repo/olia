The Ontologies of Linguistic Annotations (OLiA) provide an OWL/DL taxonomy of data categories as a reference for linguistic annotation (OLiA Reference Model), plus OWL/DL models for a large number of annotation schemes (OLiA Annotation Models) and their relationship to reference data categories (OLiA Linking Models). 
The OLiA Reference Model itself is linked to community-maintained repositories such as GOLD (http://linguistics-ontology.org/) and ISOcat (http://www.isocat.org).

The OLiA ontologies were originally developed in the context of [an infrastructure for the sustainable maintenance of linguistic resources](http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/c2/index-engl.html), and they have been applied for [the formalization of annotation schemes](https://jlcl.org/content/2-allissues/18-Heft1-2008/Chiarcos.pdf), [concept-based querying](http://lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2008/pdf/139_paper.pdf) over heterogeneously annotated corpora, the development of [interoperable NLP pipelines](https://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html), and as a central hub for annotation terminology in the [Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)](http://linguistic-lod.org) cloud.

From 2005-2011, the OLiA ontologies were hosted at the [University of Potsdam, Germany](http://nachhalt.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/owl/), 2012-2019 at  [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/olia/), and since 2019 at [Github](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia). Please do not directly refer to any of these repositories nor any other mirror, but use (and consult) links under [http://purl.org/olia](http://purl.org/olia/olia.owl), instead. 

OLiA has been designed as an open source resource and has always been released as such. The SourceForge edition (until 2019) used CC-BY-SA 3.0. For up-to-date licensing information and the necessary attribution, please see http://purl.org/olia/Readme.md.
