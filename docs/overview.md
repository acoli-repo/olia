# Ontology of Linguistic Annotation: Overview (2007)

> **Note**: This document provides overview over and design decisions of the modular architecture of OLiA and the design of the OLiA Reference. However, it has been written in 2007 and partially updated only. The original is available from the [University of Potsdam, Germany](http://nachhalt.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/index.html). Major difference partially addressed here only include the coverage of syntax and discourse annotations that have been added in 2008, and 2014, respectively.

## A structured ontology

The OLiA ontology consists of three major components, i.e.:

-   a number of domain models (OLiA Annotation Models) which are ontologies that each represent
    one annotation scheme or tag set,
-   the OLiA Reference Model, previously also referred to as "interface model" or, in its first draft version," the E-EAGLES ontology" includes
    reference definitions and thus serves as a terminological backbone
    by reference to which Annotation Model concepts are defined in a
    standardised manner, and
-   the linking between a Annotation Model and the Reference Model which is
    specified in a separate ontology (Linking Model) that is set apart from both models. 

This tripartite structure can be augmented by the optional linking of
the Reference Model with additional upper models (External Reference Models). As a result, these
upper models can be applied for the formulation of search queries as an
alternative to the reference terminology specified in the interface
model. Reference definitions retrievable from upper models to domain
models are thus mediated by the Reference Model.

We claim that this modular approach is more flexible as it allows
alternative specifications of linking and the inclusion of alternative
upper models as well as additional Annotation Models. In present-day
annotation technology, it finds a close pendant in the standoff paradigm
according to which different levels of annotation and the primary data
have to be separated from each other in order to allow for distributed
maintenance and concurrent modification. Besides these advantages, it
allows for user-specific modifications (such as the specification of
alternative upper models) without compromising the ontology as a whole.

## Drafting the OLiA Reference Model

The OLiA Reference Model provides shared terminology for linguistic annotation of various phenomena, with a focus on morphosyntax and syntax. Semantics has been excluded as we assume this is sufficiently covered by WordNet, FrameNet, etc., and should be modelled in the context of an initiative on lexical resources rather than annotated corpora. 
> **Update 2011**: Such an initiative is represented by the [W3C Community Group Ontology-Lexica (OntoLex)](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/).  

> **Update 2014**: We have developed a designated extension for discourse phenomena. It is, however, not directly integrated with the OLiA Reference Model.

> **Note 2022**: The intended function of the OLiA Reference Model is not to provide reference terminology, but to serve as an interface between *numerous* annotation schemes and *numerous* community-maintained reference terminology. Originally, the OLiA Reference Model has thus been referred to as *Interface Model*, but as a result of internal discussions within the Project "Sustainability of Linguistic Data" (2005-2008, U TÃ¼bingen, U Hamburg, U Potsdam), within which the OLiA Reference Model had been created, the current name was adopted as a compromise between *Interface Model* (too vague) and *Upper Model* (too prescriptive). Note that the original text of this document originates fro m 2007 and that the term *Interface Model* continues to be occasionally used below.

The core structure of the OLiA Reference Model has been inspired by the specifications of the [EAGLES initiative](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/LE34244), revised and extended according to the [GOLD ontology](http://linguistics-ontology.org/). The first draft of the OLiA Reference Model has thus also been referred as *E(xtended)-EAGLES* ontology. By early 2007, the first version of the E-EAGLES ontology has been implemented
using OWL/DL with Protege. Currently, it covers all the obligatory and
recommended features from the EAGLES recommendations for
morpho-syntactic annotation (Wilson and Leech 1996) plus several
categories from non-EAGLES conformant tag sets (e.g. noun classifiers).

The classes in the Reference Model are retrieved from the EAGLES
recommendations in the following way:

-   obligatory features (i.e. main word classes, such as noun, verb,
    etc.) specify top-level categories
-   recommended features which specify distinctions that are not purely
    inflectional specify more fine-grained sub-categories of top-level
    categories (e.g. the type distinction of nouns: proper nouns vs.
    common nouns)
-   recommended features which specify inflectional distinctions are
    modelled as properties

As the project data includes a MULTEXT-East-based annotation scheme for
Russian, the Uppsala scheme, the relevant definitions of MULTEXT-East
have been integrated as well.

The hierarchy of verbal classes in E-Eagles is given in Fig. 1. Note
that compared to the original EAGLES recommendations, AuxillaryVerb and
VerbalNoun are redefined in order to account for non-EAGLES conformant
tag sets.

Besides this hierarchy of classes, verbs can be further specified by
properties such as hasTense, hasAspect, hasPerson, hasNumber, hasVoice,
hasSeparability, hasReflexivity and hasGender.

categories in E-Eagles](./img/image001.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## An Annotation Model: Uppsala

Annotation Models are built in a similar manner. Usually, annotation
guidelines have a document structure which specifies an otherwise
implicitly assumed hierarchical organization, thus, a similar
hierarchical structuring of concepts can be achieved.

For the tagset applied to the Uppsala corpus, the corresponding
structuring of the Annotation Model ontology is given in Fig. 2.

Again, inflectional differentiations are specified by properties in the
ontology, i.e. hasGender, hasMood, hasVoice, hasPerson, hasNumber,
hasFiniteness, hasAspect and hasTense.

Besides these abstract conceptualizations, concrete tags are integrated
as instances into the Annotation Model ontology. In Turtle pseudo-code, the definition
of the Uppsala tag `verb_finit_prt_0\_sg_neut_refl_pfipf` in the ontology
can thus be given as:

    :verb_finit_prt_0\_sg_neut_refl_pfipf a :VerbFinitPrtType; 
    :hasTense :past;  
    :hasVoice :reflexive; 
    :hasFiniteness :finite;
    :hasGender :neuter;
    :hasMood :indicative;
    :hasNumber :singular.

![Figure 2: Fragment of Annotation Model: verbal categories in the Uppsala
tag set.](./img/image003.jpg)

Further examples below adopt a slightly more compact but equivalent syntax that has been used in an ontology-based query processor operating on OLiA:

    VerbFinitPrtType and 
    hasTense(past) and 
    hasVoice(reflexive) and 
    hasFiniteness(finite) and 
    hasGender(neuter) and 
    hasMood(indicative) and 
    hasNumber(singular)

## Linking Annotation Model and Reference Model

While Annotation Model and Reference Model are specified as self-contained
ontologies in individual owl files, the linking between both is
implemented in a separate file by the rdf:description mechanism.

Basically, the linking file contains a specification of Annotation Model
classes (not instances) in terms of Reference Model classes and
properties, making up a complex inheritance structure as in Fig. 3
(restricted to subclass relationships). Note that besides the primary
classes of word types, also properties and property values from the
Annotation Model are specified as sub-properties, instances or sub-classes
of properties and classes in the Reference Model.

![Figure 3: Linking Annotation Model and Reference Model. The case of verbal
categories in the Uppsala tagset.](./img/image005.jpg)


## A sample query

The linking file imports both the Reference Model and the corresponding
Annotation Model, and thus, it represents an integrating ontology comprising
both. If multiple Annotation Models (tag sets) are considered, the
corresponding linking files (and the ontologies they import) have to be
imported by another file, the so-called master file which represents the
ontology as a whole.

In the querying scenario, then, expressions based upon classes and
properties in the Reference Model are expanded according to the
inheritance structure within and between Reference Model and domain
models, and then evaluated.

As an example, if we are searching for past-tense reflexive verbs, a
specification like `Verb and hasTense(Past) and hasVoice(Reflexive)`
mentions the Reference Model classes `e-eagles:Verb`, `e-eagles:Past` and
`e-eagles:Reflexive` and the properties `e-eagles:hasTense` and
`e-eagles:hasVoice`. According to the interitance structure depicted in
Fig. 3, `e-eagles:Verb` expands to `russ:Verb` and further to
`russ:VerbFinitPrtType`, etc. Similarly, `e-eagles:hasTense` expands to
`russ:hasTense` etc. Thus, amongst other instances, the instance
`verb_finit_prt_0\_sg_neut_refl_pfipf` is returned.

The ontology-based query preprocessor, OntoClient, then replaces the
ontology-sensitive part of a search query by a disjunction of the tags
corresponding to the respective instances, and this modified search
query can be further processed by a corpus querying tool.

## External Reference Models: Alternative Upper Models

The very same mechanism that was used to link Annotation Model concepts with
Reference Model concepts can be employed to establish a linking between
the Reference Model and an additional upper model which provides
independent conceptualizations of linguistic terms. Candidates for such
upper models are the OntoTag ontologies (an EAGLES-based ontology of
linguistic terms with a special application to English and Iberian
languages, cf. de Cea 2004), the Data Category Registry currently
developed in the context of the Linguistic Annotation Framework (Ide et
al. 2004), or GOLD.

As illustration, we are concentrating on GOLD here, as it is a freely
available and well-recipied ontological resource with a good coverage of
non-European languages. As of January 2007, any concept in the E-EAGLES
ontology is augmented with a reference to the (E-)GOLD ontology.

Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to keep the Reference Model ontology
and the upper model apart. As the development of GOLD is still ongoing,
updated versions of GOLD could compromise the linking with the domain
models if the Annotation Models are mapped onto the upper model directly. If
both upper model and Reference Model are separated, a modification of
the upper model might force an adaption of the linking between upper
model and Reference Model, but not necessarily between the upper model
and any other existing Annotation Models.

As the upper model is linked with the Reference Model in the same way as
the Reference Model and Annotation Model, the corresponding upper model
expressions can be used for the formulation of ontology-sensitive corpus
queries.

#### Advantages of the structured approach

The crucial advantage of a structured modular ontology is its highly
flexible and user-adaptive character. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the
different components of the ontology are stored separately from each
other, and as the import mechanism relies on rdf mechanisms, the
concrete location of the corresponding files does not affect the
validity of the references. As an example, a user may prefer to use a
local variant of a certain Annotation Model, for example because his version
of the underlying annotation scheme had slightly different naming
conventions than the \"official\" Annotation Model for this annotation
scheme, for a typical example see the numerous variants of STTS which
have different tags for pronominal adverbs, e.g. PAV, PROAV and PROP. In
this case, only some instances in the Annotation Model have to be renamed,
whereas the linking can stay as it is. However, in this case the user
has to use a local copy of the linking as well which does not differ
from the \"official\" linking in any other ways than the source of the
Annotation Model to be imported.

A user thus may introduce an external upper model, he may redefine the
linking between an existing Annotation Model and the Reference Model without
affecting either of them, and he may integrate additional Annotation Models.
However, he may not modify the Reference Model. As it is the central
reference point for any linking file, this could affect the linking of
other Annotation Models and produce inconsistencies.

This modular structure is thus highly flexible and user-adaptive. A user
might even decide to disagree with the conceptualizations in the
Reference Model and develop his very own alternative, but as long as he
provides a linking between his conceptualizations and those of the
Reference Model (i.e. he implements his alternative as an upper model in
our sense), he does not have to reconsider the linking to all existing
Annotation Models.

Especially in the long run, ongoing maintenance of the ontology might
require the integration of additional upper models in order to keep
touch with the continuous process of terminological evolution, but not
the redesign of the Reference Model. The effort to have an intelligible
interface to the resources associated with certain Annotation Models is thus
reduced to the task to maintain the linking between Reference Model and
upper model.

Our implementation provides a modular view on the ontology. The ontology
consists of three principal components, the upper model presenting a
central registry of relevant terminology, several Annotation Models, each
covering the tags of one specific POS tag set, and the respective
linking between upper model and Annotation Model, which are each stored in
independent files.

To access to the ontology as a whole, an additional \"master file\" is
necessary which provides unified access to the Reference Model, the
upper model, the Annotation Models and the linking between them from
separate OWL/RDF files. As the Reference Model does not specify the
ultimate repository of linguistic terminology, additional upper models
can be integrated in this master file. As a user can define own
conceptualisations by this mechanism, the main benefit of our approach
and the development of the Reference Model lies in the fact that it is
no longer necessary to consider every tag set by its own. Instead, later
refinements are mediated by the upper model, thus the most important
achievement is that the Reference Model provides a unified access to
different tag sets for both querying and redefinition.

Besides its function in tag set neutral corpus queries and in the
theory-neutral definition of language-, project- or task-specific
annotation schemes by linking the corresponding Annotation Model with the
Reference Model, the ontology can be practically applied in the design
of tag set neutral corpus processing scripts (Krasavina et al. 2007),
or, more generally, in the field of Semantic Web applications and
ontology-based annotation (for a similar approach on a more restricted
set of languages cf. de Cea et al. 2004).
