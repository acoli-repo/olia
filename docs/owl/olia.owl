    <owl:versionInfo>EAGLES top-level category Residual (R) with the exception of its subclass
      "Unclassified". Unclassified is not represented in the OLiA ontology, as it does not
      represent information, but the absence of information.
    </owl:versionInfo>
    <rdfs:comment>
      From a linguistic point of view, Residuals are a heterogeneous class and so, Residual
      may overlap with every linguistically motivate annotation concept.
      Also between subconcepts, overlap may occur (e.g. \LaTeX 
      which is a symbol which can be read as an Acronym or acronyms which are related 
      to Abbreviations, e.g. GNU "Gnu is not Unix")
    </rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
      The residual value (R) is assigned to classes of text words which lie outside the 
      traditionally accepted range of grammatical classes, although they occur quite 
      commonly in many texts and very commonly in some. For example: foreign words, 
      or mathematical formulae. It can be argued that these are on the fringes of the 
      grammar or lexicon of the language in which the text is written. Nevertheless, 
      they need to be tagged. (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node16.html#mr 19.09.06)
      
      Although words in the Residual category are on the periphery of the lexicon, they may 
      take some of the grammatical characteristics, e.g., of nouns. Acronyms such as IBM are 
      similar to proper nouns; symbols such as alphabetic characters can vary for singular and 
      plural (e.g. How many Ps are there in `psychopath'?), and are in this respect like common 
      nouns. In some languages (e.g. Portuguese) such symbols also have gender. It is quite 
      reasonable that in some tagging schemes some of these classes of word will be classified 
      under other parts of speech. (The Unclassified category applies to word-like text segments 
      which do not easily fit into any of the foregoing values. For example: incomplete words 
      and pause fillers such as er and erm in transcriptions of speech, or written representations of singing such as dum-de-dum. (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node17.html#recr 19.09.06)</rdfs:comment>

	<owl:versionInfo>EAGLES top-level category "Noun".</owl:versionInfo>
    <rdfs:comment>
	A noun, or noun substantive, is a part of speech (a word or phrase) which can co-occur with 
	(in)definite articles and attributive adjectives, and function as the head of a noun phrase.

	The word "noun" derives from the Latin 'nomen' meaning "name", and a traditional definition 
	of nouns is that they are all and only those expressions that refer to a person, place, 
	thing, event, substance, quality, idea or an appointment. They serve as the subject or object 
	of a verb, and the object of a preposition.

		EAGLES top-level category PronounOrDeterminer (PD).
		
		The existence of this class is, however, controversial. In EAGLES, it 
		has been introduced for reasons of lexical ambiguity in European languages 
		thus it could be described by the joint of Pronoun and Determiner rather 
		than as an independent class.
		Indeed, at least one fundamental difference is blurred here: 
		Determiners are purely modifiers whereas pronouns contribute independent 
		meaning. This could be adopted here as a criterion for higher-level organization 
		of the OLiA Reference Model.
		
		The original EAGLES definition is not very specific about the difference between 
		Pronouns and Determiners. Here, we assume two definitions:
		
		* semantic definition of pronouns: Pronouns are bound variables. They are referential.
		* syntactic definition of determiners: Determiners turn nominal expressions (of type &lt;e,t&gt;) into 
		  noun phrases (of type &lt;e&gt;).

		Note that these definitions are not exclusive (which is why annotation schemes differ in this aspect). 
		Attributive possessive pronouns ('my book', 'their article') are semantically pronouns (they have an 
		independent reference), but syntactically determiners.
		For the sub-classes, no exclusivity is required as Olia allows a hybrid ("both") category by multiple 
		inheritance.
	</owl:versionInfo>
    <rdfs:comment>
		The parts of speech Pronoun, Determiner and Article heavily overlap in their formal and functional 
		characteristics, and different analyses for different languages entail separating them out in 
		different ways.
		In Eagles, Pronouns and Determiners are placed in one `super-category'. For some descriptions it may 
		be thought best to treat them as totally different parts of speech.

	<owl:versionInfo>EAGLES top-level category Unique (U).
	
		"The unique value (U) is applied to categories with a unique or
		very small membership, such as negative particle, which are
		‘unassigned’ to any of the standard part-of-speech categories. The
		value unique cannot always be strictly applied, since (for example)
		Greek has three negative particles ... 
		No subcategories are recommended, although it is expected that
		tagsets for individual languages will need to identify such one-member
		word-classes as Negative particle, Existential particle, Infinitive
		marker, etc" (http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node16.html)
	
		According to the EAGLES definition and examples, this seems to be closely related to "particle".
		Particles are uninflected function words, in a broader sense, everything which is not inflected is a 
		particle, i.e. including interjections, in GOLD, uninflected items such as adpositions, 
		conjunctions and interjections are excluded: "A particle is a partOfSpeech whose members 
		do not belong to one of the main classes of words, is invariable, and typically has grammatical 
		or pragmatic meaning."
		
		The EAGLES definition emphasizes the invariability of particles.

    <rdfs:comment>
		Unique approximates the linguistic concept "Particle".
		It covers categories with unique or very small membership, 
		such as negative particle, which are `unassigned' to any of the standard part-of-speech categories. 
		(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node16.html#mp 19.09.06)
		
		Unique elements are uninflected (hence the name) and can be used to mark uninflectable function words in OLiA, even if they are not conventionally referred to as "particles" (e.g., the common [non-inflected] relative pronoun in opposition to the specific [inflectable] relative pronoun in Arabic).
		OLiA particles are a sub-class of Unique.

      In morphosyntactic annotation schemes, a symbol is a single graphical sign 
      that occurs in a written text with a conventionalized meaning but that
      does not represent a phoneme (like ordinary characters), an orthogaphic sign (punctuation),
      or a number. (Christian Chiarcos)
      
      Symbols such as alphabetic characters can vary for singular and plural 
      (e.g. How many Ps are there in `psychopath'?), and are in this respect 
      like common nouns. In some languages (e.g. Portuguese) such symbols also have gender.

      An acronym is an abbreviation, such as NATO, laser, and ABC, written as the initial 
      letter or letters of words, and pronounced on the basis of this abbreviated written 
      form. Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or

		<rdfs:comment>A title designates the function or the social status of an individual. Often, it accompanies a proper noun, but it can also be used in place of a proper noun (if the bearer of the title is contextually unambiguous).
			E.g. "The/Det German/Adj Chancellor/Title Angela/Name Merkel/Name said ..." can be used besides "the German Chancellor said ...".
			Accordingly, some schemes (e.g., Chungku et al. 2010, for Dzongkha) group titles together with proper names (http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#ParticularPersonNoun).
			
			However, if multiple people hold the same title, they can be referred to as a group, e.g., "Since WWII, the politics of the German chancellors always followed ...", and in this usage, 
			titles are more comparable to common nouns.
			Functionally, titles are thus an intermediate category between CommonNoun and ProperNoun (cf. also Mulkern 1996).
			
			Titles do, however, share important characteristics with common nouns. 
			In English, for example, titles generally require a definite determiner (unlike proper nouns), even if unambiguous ("the pope"). 
			They are thus classified here as a subtype of CommonNoun.

			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)
			(IIIT (2007), A Part of Speech Tagger for Indian Languages (POS tagger), Tagset developed at IIIT - Hyderabad after consultations with several institutions through two workshops. available under http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf)

			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."

	 A gerund is a kind of verbal noun that exists in some languages. In today's English, 
	 gerunds are nouns built from a verb with an '-ing' suffix. They can be used as the 
	 subject of a sentence, an object, or an object of preposition. They can also be used 
	 to complement a subject. Often, gerunds exist side-by-side with nouns that come from 
	 the same root but the gerund and the common noun have different shades of meaning.

	The term _gerund_ is ambiguous: with respect  to Latin, in whose grammatical tradition it originates, it refers to a  deverbal noun, and is needed in this function for Polish as well; in  descriptions of some other languages, however, it has been used for an  adverbial participle.  
	The two meanings have nothing in common, except  that the English _ing_-form can translate both. (Ivan A Derzhanski, email 2010/06/09)
	Here, it is assumed that Gerund refers only to deverbal nouns, cf. NominalNonfiniteVerb in the IIIT tagset (http://purl.org/olia/iiit.owl#NominalNonFiniteVerb)

		<owl:versionInfo>http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#LightVerb, for Farsi</owl:versionInfo>
		<rdfs:comment>In linguistics, a light verb is a verb participating in complex predication that has little semantic content of its own, but provides through inflection some details on the event semantics, such as aspect, mood, or tense. The semantics of the compound, as well as its argument structure, are determined by the head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V or V+N compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator verb, emphasising its role within the compound; or thin verb or semantically weak verb, emphasising (as with "light") its lack of semantics. A "semantically weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak inflection. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs in some ways.
			
			Most English light verbs occur in V+N forms sometimes called "stretched verbs": for example, take in take a nap, where the primary sense is provided by "nap", and "take" is the light verb. The light verbs most common in these constructions are also common in phrasal verbs. A verb which is "light" in one context may be "heavy" in another: as with "take" in I will take a book to read.
			
			Examples in other languages include the Yiddish geb in geb a helf (literally give a help, "help"); the French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, "pretend"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall, "start to leave"); and the bǎ construction in Chinese.[1] Some verbs are found in many such expressions; to reuse an earlier example, take is found in take a nap, take a shower, take a sip, take a bow, take turns, and so on. Light verbs are extremely common in Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, and other languages in which verb compounding is a primary mechanism for marking aspectual distinctions.

		<rdfs:comment>    
		An auxiliary verb is a verb which accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase, 
		and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as 
		person, number, tense aspect, and voice. 
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAuxiliaryVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
		Besides modal verbs ("semiauxiliary") and "strict" auxiliary verbs, also copulas 
		are classified under auxiliary verbs here, as this is a praxis applied in practically every
		EAGLES-conformant morphosyntactic annotation scheme.

		Part of speech referring to the set of verbs, subordinate to the main lexical verb which help 
		to make distinction in mood, aspect, voice etc.

			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.

			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1v 20.09.06)
			
			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.

			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive).
			
			PartitiveCase expresses the partial nature of the referent of the noun

			referent is a part. This case may be found in items such as the 
			following: existential clauses, nouns that are accompanied by numerals

			is made. It often has a meaning similar to the English word 'some'.

			When the subject is conjoined, the reflexive cannot refer to only one of them. The proform has to be a distributive pronoun, i.e., the reduplicated form, when it has coreference to respective subjects, e.g.,			
			*kumaarum_i/Kumar.and umaavum_j/Uma.and tan_i+j/self-poss puunekki/cat.to paalu/milk kuDuttaanaanga/give-pst-aggr.
			"*Kumar_i and Uma gave milk to his_i/her_j cat."
			(Annamalai 2000, p. 189, on Tamil)
			
			Unlike reciprocals, the two parts of a distributive pronoun cannot be considered as two full, independent NPs. In "awar/1 awar/2", only "awar/2" is case marked; "awar/1" is its citation form. Also, the two parts cannot be separated by intervening material (cf. English "one another").

			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.

Punctuation marks that set off a parenthetical (i.e., commas, dashes, parentheses (-LRB- and -RRB-)) are contained within the PRN node. Use of PRN is determined ultimately by individual annotator intuition, though the presence of dashes or parentheses strongly suggests a parenthetical.

			"Ordinal adjective" entered ISOcat from MULTEXT-East, where it was originally applied to relational adjectives (Slovene, Resian, Ukrainian, Czech).
			"Ordinal adjective" is a mistranslation from Slovene _vrstni pridevniki_ that should be properly rendered in English as "relational adjective" (Derzhanski and Kotsyba 2009).
			However, the Macedonian MULTEXT v.4 guidelines use this category for ordinal numerals. Due to its inherent ambiguity, this category is to be avoided.

		<rdfs:comment>The izāfat (pronounced as a shorter form of –ē–) is an enclitic of Persian origin which 
			is used in Farsi and neighboring languages.
			In Urdu, it can be considered a preposition under certain circumstances: it links
			two nouns in a possessive relationship, although the phrase thus produced may often
			have a different meaning to a phrase produced with the native Urdu postposition kā.
			However, the izāfat may also join a noun to an adjective, in which case it is not so
			clearly accurate to describe it as a preposition parallel to the prepositions in European
			languages for which the EAGLES guidelines were compiled. A better way to treat
			izāfat is in the context of the Unique category of miscellaneous one-member wordclasses,
			discussed below.

			A classifier is a word or affix that expresses the classification of a noun.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAClassifier.htm 19.09.06)

			Classifiers are a very typical feature of sign languages.
			In some Asian languages, classifiers are used as particles to combine a noun with a numeral,
			e.g. chin. _san ge ren_ 'three pieces of people', 'three people' (Bußmann 2002, under Klassifikator)
			
			Bharati et al. (2006, for Indian languages) group Classifiers together with Quantifiers and Numerals, but they do not provide a detailed characterization of this class.

			A set of aspectual distinctions involving relations between a background 
			situation (the reference situation) and a situation located relative to 
			the reference situation (the denoted situation). In English, phasal 
			distinctions are expressed by auxiliary-headed constructions, like the 
			inceptive, progressive, and perfect constructions, whose head verbs express 
			the aspectual class of the denoted situation. The aspectual class of the 
			denoted situation differs from that of the reference situation 
			(Michaelis 1998:xv). 
			An event may have a beginning and an end, a middle portion (continuing or 
			changing), and also an ensuing result or an altered state. These are 
			considered to be the various “phases‽ of an event. A speaker may talk about 
			an event from the point of view of any of these individual phases, and his 
			language may have inflectional (or other type of) markers for representing 
			these distinctions. Since such markers indicate distinctions in the temporal 
			structure of an event, we may regard them as belonging to the category of 
			aspect. It has been suggested (Dik 1989: 186) that these may be grouped 
			under a subcategory (or “level") of aspect called “phasal aspect".

			ProgressiveAspect, also called the continuative or the durative,

			generally be encoded with the progressive (Comrie 1976: 32-35; 
			Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca 1994: 127-139; Payne 1997: 240). An

		<rdfs:comment>The jussive is needed to express a command in the first and third person. This mood is realised in Arabic by rejecting the final vowel and is sometimes called the apocopated imperfect.

The purpose of the jussive is to express a command in the first or third person as in ‘heena yahduru yalbas thiyaban nazyfatan’ which means “when he attends, let him (he must) wear clean clothes”, where the jussive is the word ‘yalbas’ “wear”. Also, there is no negative imperative in Arabic, so the negative particle followed by the jussive is used in its place, such as ‘la taktub’ “do not write”, where the jussive is the word ‘taktub’ “write”.

			The comparative is the form of an adjective or adverb which denotes 
			the degree or grade by which a person, thing, or other entity has a 
			property or quality greater or less in extent than that of another. 
			In English the structure of a comparative consists normally of the 
			positive form of the adjective or adverb, plus the suffix -er, or 
			(especially in the case of longer words) the modifier "more" (or 
			"less") before the adjective or adverb. The form is usually completed 
			by "than" and the noun which is being compared, e.g. "he is taller 
			than his father is", or "the village is less picturesque than the 
			town near by is". (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative  17.11.06)

		<rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">MULTEXT-East Degree="elative" (Adjective: Resian, Serbian, Macedonian)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			In Semitic languages, ElativeDegree refers to the “adjective of superiority.” In some languages such as Arabic, the concepts of comparative and superlative degree of an adjective are merged into a single form, the elative. How this form is understood or translated depends upon context and definiteness. In the absence of comparison, the elative conveys the notion of “greatest”, “supreme.” The elative of كبير (kabí:r, "big") is أكبر (’ákbar, “bigger/biggest”, “greater/greatest”). (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elative)
			
			In Slavic languages, as well, it is pretty standard. I do agree with the definition though, that "the elative conveys the notion of “greatest”, “supreme.”" So, Slovene "lep" is beautiful, "prelep" is very (or supremely) beautiful; I guess the "pre-" prefix could be roughly translated as "over-". Used in Resian, Serbian, Macedonian. In Slovenian, we banished it, as even "ordinary" degrees are borderline inflection / derivation, but, I think, elative is is definitely not inflection.

			The distributive case is used on nouns for the meanings of per or each, e.g., Hungarian egyenként/egy, hetenként/hét, ilyenként/ily, kéthetenként/kéthét, rekordonként/rekord, tömbönként/tömb, vércsoportonként/vércsoport
			
			In Hungarian it is -nként and expresses the manner when something happens to each member of a set one by one (e.g., fejenként "per head", esetenként "in some case"), or the frequency in time (hetenként "once a week", tízpercenként "every ten minutes").
			In the Finnish language, this adverb type is rare, even rarer in the singular. Its ending is -ttain/-ttäin. The basic meaning is "separately for each". For example, maa ("country") becomes maittain for an expression like Laki ratifioidaan maittain ("The law is ratified separately in each country"). It can be used to distribute the action to frequent points in time, e.g., päivä (day) has the plural distributive päivittäin (each day). It can mean also "in (or with) regard to the (cultural) perspective" when combined with a word referring to an inhabitant (-lais-). Frequently Finns (suomalaiset) say that suomalaisittain tuntuu oudolta, että, or "in the Finnish perspective, it feels strange that".

			The Hungarian "formativus, or essivus-formalis `-ként' ... usually expresses a position, task and manner of the person or the thing." (Nose 2003), e.g., Hungarian 'katonaként' -&gt; [serves] as a soldier. (Csaba Oravecz, email 2010/06/15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			
			"Haspelmath &amp; Buchholz (1998:321) explained the function of the essive case as ``role phrases''. Role phrases represent the role of the function in which a participant appears. They regard the role phrases as adverbial."
			(Nose 2003, p. 117)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			In the Hungarian language this case combines the Essive case and the Formal case, and it can express the position, task, state (e.g. "as a tourist"), or the manner (e.g. "like a hunted animal"). The status of the suffix -ként in the declension system is disputed for several reasons. First, in general, Hungarian case suffixes are absolute word-final, while -ként permits further suffixation by the locative suffix -i. Second, most Hungarian case endings participate in vowel harmony, while -ként does not. For these reasons, many modern analyses of the Hungarian case system, starting with László Antal's "A magyar esetrendszer" (1961) do not consider the essive/formal to be a case.

			The multiplicative case is a grammatical case used for marking a number of something ("three times").
			The case is found in the Hungarian language, for example nyolc (eight), nyolcszor (eight times).
			The case appears also in Finnish as an adverbial (adverb-forming) case. Used with a cardinal number it denotes the number of actions; for example, viisi (five) -&gt; viidesti (five times). Used with adjectives it refers to the mean of the action, corresponding the English suffix -ly: kaunis (beautiful) -&gt; kauniisti (beautifully). It is also used with a small number of nouns: leikki (play) -&gt; leikisti (just kidding, not really). In addition, it acts as an intensifier when used with a swearword: piru -&gt; pirusti.

			The partitive case is a grammatical case which denotes "partialness", 
			"without result", or "without specific identity".
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#partitiveCase 
			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive)
			
			PartitiveCase expresses the partial nature of the referent of the 
			noun it marks, as opposed to expressing the whole unit or class 
			of which the referent is a part. This case may be found in items 
			such as the following: existential clauses, nouns that are 
			accompanied by numerals or units of measure, or predications of 
			material from which something is made. It often has a meaning 
			similar to the English word 'some' (Pei and Gaynor 1954: 161; 
			Richards, Platt, and Weber 1985: 208; Quirk, et al. 1985: 249; 
			Gove, et al. 1966: 1648; Sebeok 1946: 1214).

      <rdfs:comment>morphological form of the nominal head of noun+noun-phrases which in spite of a missing determiner (article) is invariably understood as semantically determined. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2997)
	  
	  The construct state or status constructus is a noun form occurring in Afro-Asiatic languages. It is particularly common in Semitic languages (such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac), in the Berber languages, and in the extinct Egyptian language. ... 
	  In Semitic languages, nouns are placed in the construct state when they are semantically definite and modified by another noun in a genitive construction. Note that this differs from the genitive case of European languages in that it is the head (modified) noun rather than the dependent (modifying) noun which is marked. However, in Semitic languages with grammatical case (e.g. Classical Arabic), the modifying noun in a genitive construction is placed in the genitive case, in addition to marking the head noun with the construct state. ...
	  The construct state is one of the three grammatical states of nouns in Arabic, the other two being the indefinite state and the definite state. ... (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_state)</rdfs:comment>
	  <owl:versionInfo>According to the Arabic usage of this category, modeled here as a DefinitenessFeature, though not directly a subconcept of definite, because it has other functions in other languages.</owl:versionInfo>

				The EAGLES-recommended attribute Possessive accounts for the fact that a possessive

				it has by virtue of agreeing with a particular noun (e.g. Italian "(la) mia", "(le) mie)".

(11) Ryukichi Imai, Japan’s ambassador to Mexico, agrees that Mexico may be too eager.

Here, Ryukichi Imai is the nucleus phrase, and the phrase enclosed in commas, Japan’s ambassador to
Mexico, is the appositive.
Instances of apposition should be represented as adjunction structures (see Section 3.1).

			Such examples should be bracketed as adjunction structures.

			(ii) if the fronted element is left-dislocated (i.e., it is associated with a resumptive pronoun in the position of the gap).

			Fronted elements are placed inside the top clause level (e.g. S, SINV, SQ, SBAR).

In a German clause, the finite verb can appear in three different positions: verb-second, 
verb-initial, and verb-final. Only in verb-final clauses the verb complex consisting of the
finite verb and non-finite verbal elements forms a unit. The discontinuous positioning
of the verbal elements in verb-first and verb-second clauses is the traditional reason
for structuring German clauses into fields. The positions of the verbal elements form
the Satzklammer (sentence bracket) which divides the sentence into a Vorfeld (initial
field), a Mittelfeld (middle field), and a Nachfeld (final field). The Vorfeld and the
Mittelfeld are divided by the linke Satzklammer (left sentence bracket), which is the finite

The Verbkomplex is a sequence of verb forms. In verb-second and verb-first
clauses it consists of one or more non-finite elements or - depending on the verb - of
a separable prefix. In verb-final clauses it also contains the finite verb. The rule for
the linear order in general is: right determines left. If there is a finite verb in the verb
complex, it is usually the right-most element.

The C-Feld occurs in verb-final clauses in German (exception: the conjunction als in
subordinated sentences of comparison als w¨are es nie geschehen.). It is obligatorily
occupied in finite verb-final clauses if there is no conjunction in the Linke Klammer. In
non-finite verb-final clauses the C-position may be empty. This field can be occupied by
conjunctions of sentential objects (e.g. daß, ob) or sentence initial conjunctions like um,
obwohl, wenn and also by complex interrogative or relative phrases, e.g. ..., ’um wieviel
Geld’ geht es dabei? / ..., ’an der’ Max Daniel Professor f¨ur Klavier ist.

			The maximal, syntactically independent, segments into which a text is subdivided, 
			for parsing purposes, are normally considered to be sentences. In a written text, 
			they are typically (though by no means invariably) delimited by an initial capital 
			letter and a final full stop (`.') or other terminal punctuation. It is convenient 
			to accept this primary orthographic definition of `sentence' for the purposes of 
			syntactic annotation. However, a sentence, so defined, may be either a full 
			sentence (9) or a `grammatically incomplete' one (10).

			(9)  	[S This is a sentence. S]
			(10)  	[S Well done. S]

			The same applies to sentences included within other sentences, as in (11)

			(11)  	[S [S ``Well done'', S] she said. S] }
			
			``Well done'' in 11 is labelled as a sentence, since it clearly has an independent 
			syntactic status equivalent to those of 9, even though it is included in another 
			sentence. This inclusion of one independent sentence within another is found both 
			with reported speech and elsewhere. Phenomena such as those illustrated in 10 are 
			by no means exceptional in text corpora.

			In transcriptions of spoken discourse, there is no simple answer to the question 
			``What is a sentence?''. Some transcriptions, based on standard orthography, yield 
			de facto sentences in the form of units beginning with a capital letter and closing 
			with a terminal punctuation mark. For these, there is no problem in recognising the 
			primary sentential segments and delimiting them by [S ... S], even though these 
			segments frequently lack the canonical structure of a complete written sentence. 
			Moreover, even in other transcriptions, where the standard orthographic practices of 
			sentence delimitation are avoided, it is possible to identify `primary segments' 
			analogous to the written sentence, viz. the primary units into which the transcribed 
			discourse is divided for parsing purposes. For spoken as well as written language, 
			then, the [S] unit may be retained, although it may be interpreted differently, and 
			some other term, such as `primary segment', may be preferred to `sentence'.

			We conclude by recommending, for the syntactic annotation of any text (including a 
			transcription of spoken language), an exhaustive division of the text into units 
			labelled [S ... S].

			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S]

			SubordinateClause is the class of clauses that cannot stand on their

			'Mary is sick' is the subordinate clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SubordinateClause)

			Dependent clauses (which are also sometimes referred to as subordinate 
			clauses) cannot stand alone as sentences. They usually begin with

			MainClause is the class of clauses that can stand on their own as a full, independent sentence. 
			If a sentence contains any embedded clauses, the main clause is understood as the matrix plus 
			the embedded clauses. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 'John thinks that Mary 
			is sick' is the main clause [Crystal 2001, 231].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/MainClause)

			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NounPhrase)
		</rdfs:comment>
		<rdfs:comment>
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'

			VerbPhrase is the class of phrases that have verbs as heads. They can play the role of predicate in a main clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/VerbPhrase)
		</rdfs:comment>
		<rdfs:comment>
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

			Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
			whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
			way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
			standard VP-tests.

			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

			Adverb phrases may function as adverbials, as in 41:

			(41)  	[NP Her beautiful white hat NP] [VP was [ADVP very nearly ADVP] ruined VP]
			
			or as modifiers of adjectives, as in 42:
			
			(42)  	[NP Il NP] [VP parle [ADVP infiniment plus couramment ADVP] VP]

			or noun phrases, as in 43:

			(43)  	[NP They NP] [VP let [NP me NP] [VP speak VP] [ADVP now and then ADVP] VP]
			
			or as the complement of a preposition, as in 44:
			
			(44)  	[ADVP Strangely enough ADVP] , [NP we NP] [VP received [NP a reply NP] [NP the next day NP] VP]

		<rdfs:comment>
			As has already been shown in some of the preceding examples, the issue of coordination necessarily arises: how is
			coordination to be represented in terms of constituency? Different approaches have been taken, and in the example
			analyses given in this document, we have chosen to take a traditional approach, showing the coordinated constituents
			at the same level, with the conjunction between them (see also 47 and 48):

			(51)  	[NP [NP John NP] and [NP Mary NP] NP]
			(52)  	She went [PP [PP to the library PP] or [PP to the cafeteria PP] PP]
			(53)  	He works [ADVP [ADVP very slowly ADVP] but [ADVP very meticulously ADVP] ADVP]
			
			However, in practice, in an automated parsing system, this is not an easy differentiation to make, and in some
			existing schemes, a slightly less satisfactory solution has been found, viz. analysing coordination in a similar
			fashion to subordination.

			Most constituents (both phrases and clauses) can be coordinated, but the extent to which this is possible will
			differ across languages. The conjuncts may be marked as such by separate descriptors: NPtex2html_wrap_inline4084
			etc. However, there are many occasions where the conjuncts are not of the same formal category, or where they do not
			correspond to an entire phrasal or clausal constituent. There is much to be said, in these cases, or perhaps for all
			cases of coordination, for the use of a generalised label applied to all coordinate constituents or conjuncts, e.g.
			the label CO used in the TOSCA system. We do not offer a definitive solution for the annotation of coordination, and
			the many variants of coordination will not be considered further in this report. See Sampson (1995: 310f) for a
			detailed treatment.

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.org/olia/olia.owl#PrepositionalPhrase">
		<rdfs:comment>
			A sequence of a preposition and its complement is a prepositional phrase. The complement of a preposition is usually
			a noun phrase (see examples 38 to 40), but may also be a clause or an adverb phrase. According to the categories
			recommended here, a prepositional phrase may be analysed further into preposition and noun phrase. The examples
			below demonstrate how this further analysis can be a recursive procedure.

			(38)  	[PP en [NP sustitucion [PP de [NP los canales correspondientes [PP de [NP 50 baudios NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP].
			(39)  	[NP Fairbanks NP] [VP hummed [NP a few bars NP] VP] [PP in [NP a voice [VP made resonant 
					[PP by [NP the very weakness [PP of [NP his chest NP] PP] NP] PP] VP] NP] PP].
			(40)  	[PP En [NP el caso [PP de [NP un sistema mixto [PP en [NP el 
					[CL que [VP se utilicen [NP canales [PP con [NP tres velocidades 
					[PP de [NP modulacion NP] PP] diferentes NP] PP] NP] VP] CL] NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP]

			In a language such as Spanish, where a large proportion of the modification of nouns takes the form of a following
			preposition de and another noun, this recursion is extremely prevalent, as in 40. In cases where the prepositional
			phrase is complemented by a one word noun phrase, it may be advantageous to leave the analysis at this point, rather
			than continuing to analyse further by enclosing the complement (see also one-word constituents).

			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax

		</rdfs:comment>

The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).

        The subject of a sentence is one of the two main parts of a sentence, 
        the other being the predicate. Providing an adequate definition of the 
        notion of a subject is notoriously difficult, and depends on a range 
        of grammatical properties that may vary from language to language. For 
        this reason, many current grammatical theories avoid using the term, 
        except for purely descriptive purposes, or define it in terms of 
        occupying a particular position in the clause. The term subject refers 
        to the grammatical function an expression may have in relation to 
        other expressions in a sentence, and it should be distinguished from 
        parts of speech, which classify expressions independently of their 
        relations to other constituents of a sentence.

        The subject of a verb is the argument which generally refers to the 
        origin of the action or the undergoer of the state shown by the verb. 
        However, this definition depends on the particular language under 
        consideration. In languages where a passive voice exists, the subject 
        of a passive verb may be the target or result of the action. This is a 
        semantic definition. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)).

			In linguistics, the object of a transitive verb is one of its core 
			arguments, which generally represents the target of the verb's action or 
			the undergoer of its effects. In more general terms, an object is a 
			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)
			
			An object, traditionally defined, is either a direct object or an indirect object. 
			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject 
			(Crystal 1985: 211; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 155-156; Mish et al. 1990: 814, Comrie 1989: 66).

			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of

			 direct object and the oblique object on the basis of multiple    
			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following: 
				(i) Having a particular case marking, commonly dative 
				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number 
				(iii) Being distinct from oblique relations in that it may be relativized

		A direct object is a grammatical relation that exhibits a combination of certain 
		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object

		<rdfs:comment>In linguistics, a compound is a lexeme (less precisely, a word) that consists of more than one stem. Compounding or composition is the word formation that creates compound lexemes (the other word-formation process being derivation). Compounding or Word-compounding refers to the faculty and device of language to form new words by combining or putting together old words. In other words, compound, compounding or word-compounding occurs when a person attaches two or more words together to make them one word. The meanings of the words interrelate in such a way that a new meaning comes out which is very different from the meanings of the words in isolation.
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_%28linguistics%29)

			Echo word is a linguistic term that refers to a particular kind of reduplication which is a widespread areal feature in the languages of South Asia. Echo words are characterized by reduplication of a complete word or phrase, with the initial segment or syllable of the reduplicant being overwritten by a fixed segment or syllable. In most languages in which this phenomenon is present, echo words serve to express a meaning of "... and such; and things like that." In some cases the echo word may express a depreciative meaning as well.
			
			Echo words in Hindi are typically created with a fixed initial v:
			aam 	"mango"
			aam vaam 	"mangoes and the like"
			tras 	"grief"
			tras vras 	"grief and the like"

		<rdfs:comment>
			Strong inflection is a characteristic of lexemes, not individual tokens.
			In traditional English tagsets, e.g., SUSANNE  or the PennTreeBank tagset, surface ambiguities are normally not resolved.
			Uninflected forms and forms that have the same form (e.g., "be" as an imperative) are tagged as BaseForm. (Ch. Chiarcos)
			
			Since it is impractical (...) to resolve automatically the 
			ambiguity of these six morphological functions, it is a common practice to assign a single value to the base form, 
			or else to assign two values, one for the finite and one for the non-finite functions. Because of this, the tables 
			below show two tagsets: one tagset representing the 6 attribute-values above, and a reduced tagset (`RTags'), which
			resembles most tagsets so far used for the English language in reducing the six values to two.
			http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/morphsyn/node150.html#SECTION00054000000000000000
			
			BaseForm is not a characteristic of lexemes, but specific to certain forms in a complex paradigm.

		<rdfs:comment>
			In many inflecting languages, there occur lexemes whose form does not change throughout the paradigm, e.g.,
			Russian papa "dad". For such forms, the category uninflected may be assigned.
			However, Uninflected is not to be confused with BaseForm that applies to forms in a paradigm where overt
			marking exists.
			
			Uninflected is a characteristic of lexemes, not individual tokens.
		</rdfs:comment>
		<owl:versionInfo>For the EMILLE tagset (for Urdu, Hardi 2003), we need the possibility to specify that a lexeme is (un)inflected ([un]marked) *for a specific feature* (e.g., Gender, http://purl.org/olia/emille.owl#GenderMarking).
			At the moment, this cannot be expressed.</owl:versionInfo>

			Weak pronouns are helping pronouns many languages have for easily

			belongs. Many languages have different ways to express this. For

			Germanic languages and Romance languages have the same, but inflect

			A fixed, lexicalized phrase. (Sue Ellen Wright, http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-341)
			
			A set phrase or fixed phrase is a phrase whose parts are fixed in a certain order, even if the phrase could be changed without harming the literal meaning. This is because a set phrase is a culturally accepted phrase. A set phrase does not necessarily have any literal meaning in and of itself. Set phrases may function as idioms (e.g. red herring) or as words with a unique referent (e.g. Red Sea). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_phrase, with reference to McArthur, TomsamDam.

		Semantic valency pertains to the number of semantic arguments a predicate takes.
		This is not necessarily the same as syntactic valency: In English, expletive "it" is

		<rdfs:comment>The presumptive mood is used in Romanian to express presupposition or hypothesis regarding the fact denoted by the verb, as well as other more or less similar attitudes: doubt, curiosity, concern, condition, indifference, inevitability. For example, acolo s-o fi dus "he might have gone there" shows the basic presupposition use, while the following excerpt from a poem by Eminescu shows the use both in a conditional clause de-o fi "suppose it is" and in a main clause showing an attitude of submission to fate le-om duce "we would bear".
			
			De-o fi una, de-o fi alta... Ce e scris și pentru noi,
			Bucuroși le-om duce toate, de e pace, de-i război.
			
			Be it one, be it the other... Whatever fate we have,
			We will gladly go through all, be it peace or be it war

      	In Inuktitut, conditionality is expressed by verbal inflection. Conditional mood signifies conditional relationships in a sentence. (Nowak 1996, p.39)
      	
      	A conditional relation is a logical relation in which the illocutionary act employing one of a pair of propositions is expressed or implied to be true or in force if the other proposition is true.

        <rdfs:comment>Alternative lexicalization: a discourse relation is inferred, but insertion of an
Implicit connective leads to redundancy in its expression due to the relation being alternatively
lexicalized by some other expression.

These are cases where a discourse relation is inferred between adjacent sentences but where providing
an Implicit connective leads to redundancy in the expression of the relation. This is because the
relation is alternatively lexicalized by some “non-connective expression”. Such expressions include
(1) those which have two parts, one referring to the relation and another anaphorically to Arg1; (2)
those which have just one part referring anaphorically to Arg1; (3) those which have just one part
referring to the relation.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>RST: The situation presented in the nucleus comes in contrast with the situation presented in the satellite. The contrast may happen in only one or few respects, while everything else can remain the same in other respects. An ANTITHESIS relation is
always mononuclear -- it is a contrastive relation that distinguishes clearly between the nuclearity of its arguments. It differs from the mononuclear CONCESSION relation, which is characterized by a violated expectation. (Carlson and Marcu 2001)

Markers are "although", "however", and "while".

        <rdfs:comment>The relation of attribution is a relation of “ownership” between abstract objects and individuals
or agents. That is, attribution has to do with ascribing beliefs and assertions expressed in text to
the agent(s) holding or making them (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004, 2005).
(Prasad et al. 2007)

Instances of reported speech, both direct and indirect, should be marked for
the rhetorical relation of ATTRIBUTION. The satellite is the source of the attribution (a clause con-
taining a reporting verb, or a phrase beginning with according to), and the nucleus is the content
of the reported message (which must be in a separate clause). The ATTRIBUTION relation is also
used with cognitive predicates, to include feelings, thoughts, hopes, etc.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

The Satellite attributes the Nucleus to a source.
(Wolf et al. 2003)

Note that SemDok groups Attribution and Citation with Support and thus not a textual, but a presentational relation. However, we adopt the PDTB perspective in that attribution is to be modelled separately, and in accordance with its usage in text, consider it a textual device rather than a presentational relation.

        <rdfs:comment>In a BACKGROUND relation, the satellite establishes the context or the grounds

understand the nucleus. The satellite IS NOT the cause/reason/motivation of the situation pre-
sented in the nucleus. The reader/writer intentions are irrelevant in determining whether such a
relation holds. In contrast with the CIRCUMSTANCE relation, the information or the context of the
BACKGROUND relation is not always specified clearly or delimited sharply. Hence, the CIRCUM-
STANCE relation is stronger than BACKGROUND.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

        <rdfs:comment>One of the arguments describes a situation A which causes C, while the other asserts (or implies) the complement of C.
(Prasad et al. 2007)

The situation indicated in the nucleus is contrary to expectation in the light of the information presented in the satellite. In other words, a CONCESSION relation is always characterized by a violated expectation. In some cases, which text span is the
satellite and which is the nucleus do not depend on the semantics of the spans, but rather on the intention of the writer.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

A typical marker is "although" (in PTDB and RSTDTB).

Axiomatization follows SemDok Concession (subclass of Contrast). We follow SemDok in assuming that Concession is always hypotactic (mononuclear), although this is not explicit in the PDTB definitions.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that Condition is undefined with respect to nuclearity. Mononuclear relations are Consequence (condition is nucleus) and Pragmatic / Semantic Condition (condition is satellite).

RST-DTB: In a CONDITION relation, the truth of the proposition associated with the nucleus is a consequence of the fulfillment of the condition in the satellite. The satellite presents a situation that is not realized. (Carlson and Marcu 2001)

PDGB: the event described in the Nucleus can only take place if the event described in the Satellite also takes place (before or simultaneously with the event described in the Nucleus)
(Wolf et al. 2003)

PDTB: As the semantics/pragmatics differentiation of PDTB relations does not exactly correspond to the subject-matter/presentational distinction in RST, Condition was originally introduced as a generalization over SemanticCondition and PragmaticCondition. Both SemanticCondition and PragmaticCondition take the condition to be the satellite.

ISO: Condition and Negative Condition describe the relation between both arguments, the RST/PDTB/PDGB condition relations correspond to an ISO (Negative) Condition with argument (Negated) Antecedent.</rdfs:comment>

This is an annotation that marks a condition at the consequent rather than the condition, itself.

Accordinly, Consequence does not have further subclasses, but should be coupled with Condition annotations.

        <rdfs:comment>Generalization over RST/PDTB contrast and concession.

Cf. Contrast as defined by Wolf et al. (2003): Infer a set of entities from DS0, E(DS0), and a set of entities from DS1, E(DS1). Then infer contrasts between members of E(DS0) and E(DS1).
• Contrast-1 is a contrast between corresponding predicates in DS0 and DS1. The
arguments of these contrasting predicates are identical.
• Contrast-2 is a contrast between the arguments of corresponding predicates in DS0
and DS1. The predicates over these contrasting arguments are identical.

Corresponds to SemDok Contrast (generalization over Concession, Antithesis and Contrast).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The contrastive focus (cf) is that element of the sentence that evokes a notion of contrast to (an element of) another utterance. (SFB632 guidelines)

Contrastive focus may also extend over different domains of an utterance. In alternative questions and the answers to them it covers the whole CP. E.g.

WORDS: Is it raining or not ? CFocus: [ _cf It is raining] or [ _cf not]. WORDS: Yes , it is . NFocus: Yes, [ _nf it is]. CFocus: Yes, [ _cf it is]. (5.3)

        <rdfs:comment>Krifka distinguishes between ‘expression focus’ and ‘denotation focus.’ Differences in meaning are only found in the latter kind of focus, on which we concentrate here.

...

Some semantic uses of focus are focus-sensitive particles (socalled
‘association with focus’ cases), negations, reason clauses and restrictors of quantifiers.

It is important to understand which subclasses of focus can be expressed by grammatical means, even if the distinction is only realized in a small group of languages. In the SFB annotation guidelines, ‘focus’ is subcategorized into new and contrastive.

        <rdfs:comment>Relation between discourse segments. (Mann and Thompson 1988)
In order to distangle discourse-syntactic (paratactic/hypotactic) and functional-semantic aspects, DiscourseRelation is distinguished from DiscourseStructuralPattern: DiscourseRelations defined discourse relations in terms of their communicative function and underlying semantics. An RST antithesis, for example, is thus to be defined both as a ContrastRelation (subclass of DiscourseRelation) and as a HypotacticDiscourseRelation (subclass of DiscourseStructuralPattern).

Note that Attribution is modelled here as a relation (as in RST), not as a feature (as in PDTB).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:label>rhetorical relation</rdfs:label>
        <owl:versionInfo>The taxonomy of DiscourseRelations follows roughly the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al. 2007), with additions in accordance to the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (HDRB, Oza et al. 2009), the Italian LUNA corpus (Tonelli et al. 2010), the Leeds Arabic Discourse Treebank  (LADTB, Al-Saif and Markert  2010) and an alignment with Carlson and Marcu's (2001) RST relations and with Wolf et al.'s (2003, PDGB) coherence relations. Unaligned relations are marked by suffixes RST (for classical RST and RDTDTB relations) on the one hand and PDTB, HDRB, LUNA and LADTB on the other hand. No indices are used are used if a relation can be confirmed for at least two families of annotation schemes (PDTB, RSTDTB, PDGB).

We provide two, intersection subclassifications of discourse relations:
- ideational, interpersonal and textual (following SemDoc, i.e., the RST tradition)
- entity relations and (other) coherence relations (following PDTB)

With the following overlaps:
- entity relations are ideational relations
- interpersonal relations are coherence relations
- textual relations (not addressed in PDTB) are disjoint from both entity and coherence relations

However, the RST-style classification is encoded via subclasses of discourse function, the PDTB-style classification (along with additional concepts for textual patterns and dialog relations) is encoded via subclasses of discourse relation.</owl:versionInfo>

Infer a set of coherent entities, E(DS0, DS1) from DS0 and DS1. The members of E(DS0, DS1) are centered around a common event or entity, e01. (Wolf et al. 2003)

A classical discourse relation that has been applied to different kinds of dependency relations, e.g., between a set and its member(s), an abstraction and its instance(s), whole and part, process and step, object and attribute, or generalization and specific.
Since Knott et al. (2001), it seems generally accepted that elaboration is to be circumscribed by entity-based coherence, e.g., EntRel relationships as defined by Prasad et al. (2007): "no discourse relation can be inferred and where the second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first sentence".

Although Elaboration is thus closely entangled with anaphora and textual inferences, both phenomena are to be modelled separately: Elaboration is a relationship between discourse segments, whereas anaphora and bridging are relationships between discourse referents.

The subclassification of Elaboration follows SemDok. Note that we do not express directionSatellite value "left" as we do not explicitly encode positioning. 

Our modelling follows Webber and Knott (2001) in assuming that elaboration is *always* mediated by an entity relation. However, in some cases relations grouped under elaboration in one framework are grouped with other discourse relations in the PDTB tradition (e.g., ElaborationSpecification is Elaboration in RST and SemDok, but a special case of Specification/Expansion in PDTB). In these cases, we provide double classification.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>In an ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL relation, the satellite gives additional infor-
mation or detail about the situation presented in the nucleus. This relation is extremely common at
all levels of the discourse structure, and is especially popular to show relations across large spans of information. It is the default for the family of elaboration relations, and should be used when
none of the other, more specific, elaboration relations apply.

When an elaborating satellite is an embedded unit, the relation ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is used. Generally, the embedded satellite of this relation is separated from the nucleus
by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative clause, whereas an ELABORATION-OBJECT-
ATTRIBUTE-E represents a restrictive relative clause

        <rdfs:comment>SemDok Elaboration-continuation. We omitted the subclass Elaboration-continuation-other because it is unclear how this is defined. Its subclasses are, however, preserved.

SemDok treats all topic continuity relations as subclasses of elaboration, but this comes with the assumption of hypotactic relation, whereas other topic continuity relations in RST are paratactic or underdefined (see TopicContinuityRelation). We thus add these SemDok elaborations as subclasses of TopicContinuityRelation rather than merging them into a single concept.</rdfs:comment>

No definition is given. By analogy with ElaborationWholePart, we assume that this may stand for ElaborationPartWhole, but this is unconfirmed. Based on this interpretation, however, we define it as subclass of Generalization.

As a SemDok Elaboration, this is a subject-matter relation. This seems to be the main difference to SemDok Summary, which is interpersonal.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE is a relation involving a clause, usually a
postmodifier of a noun phrase, that is required to give meaning to an animate or inanimate object.
The modifying clause is the satellite, and the object it modifies is the nucleus. The satellite is
intrinsic to the meaning of the nucleus, and/or essential to understanding the context, and is
almost always an embedded unit. This relation is almost always embedded

In embedded units, ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is much more common than
ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E. The way to distinguish between ELABORATION-OBJECT-
ATTRIBUTE-E and ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E is that the former is intrinsic to the object it is
modifying in the nucleus, while the latter is extrinsic, i.e. it contains information that is incidental
and which could be omitted without loss of understanding. Usually, an ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is separated from the nucleus by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative
clause, whereas an ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E represents a restrictive relative clause.

Entity relations (which include Elaboration) are grouped with IdeationalRelations in SemDok, hence also a subclass of SubjectMatterRelation.

Note that we follow Webber and Knott (2001) to assume that Elaboration is always an entity relation (even though this entity may be abstract or implicit), however, many types of elaboration (taxonomy following SemDok) are put under Expansion in the PDTB tradition. Entity relations proper are thus only elaborations which have no other discourse relation assigned. These are (only) the sublasses of ElaborationDerivation.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>When eventuality AOs occur with attribution, it conveys an agent’s intention/attitude towards a considered event, state or action. Eventuality AOs occur with “control” types of attribution (“Ctrl” for short), conveyed by any of three different classes of control verbs (Sag and Pollard, 1991). The
first kind is anchored by a verb of influence like persuade, permit, order, and involve one agent influencing another agent to perform (or not perform) an action. The second kind is anchored by a verb of commitment like promise, agree, try, intend, refuse, decline, and involve an agent committing
to perform (or not perform) an action. The third kind is anchored by a verb of orientation like want, expect, wish, yearn, and involve desire, expectation, or some similar mental orientation towards some state(s) of affairs. These sub-distinctions are not encoded in the annotation, but we have used the definitions as a guide for identifying these predicates.

        <rdfs:comment>In an EVIDENCE relation, the situation presented in the satellite provides evi-
dence or justification for the situation presented in the nucleus. Usually EVIDENCE relations per-
tain to actions and situations that are independent of the will of an animate agent. Evidence is data
on which judgment of a conclusion may be based, and is presented by the writer or an agent in the
article to convince the reader of a point. An evidence satellite increases the chance of the reader
accepting the information presented in the nucleus.

        <rdfs:comment>Krifka distinguishes between ‘expression focus’ and ‘denotation focus.’ Differences in meaning are only found in the latter kind of focus, on which we concentrate here.

The pragmatic use of focus (or ‘management of CG’) does not
involve any change in the truth-value of the sentence. Only the semantic use of focus (or ‘content of CG’) has such an effect. Pragmatic uses of focus include answers to wh-questions, corrections, confirmations, parallel expressions and delimitations.

That part of an expression which provides the most relevant information in a particular context as opposed to the (not so relevant) rest of information making up the background of the utterance. Typically, focus on a subexpression indicates that it is selected from possible alternatives that are either implicit or given explicitly, whereas the background can be derived from the context of the utterance.

        <rdfs:comment>Subordinating or Mononuclear Relations (RST):
The most frequent structural pattern is that two spans of text (virtually always adjacent, but exceptions can be found) are related such that one of them has a specific role relative to the other. A paradigm case is a claim followed by evidence for the claim. RST posits an "Evidence" relation between the two spans. It also says that the claim is more essential to the text than the particular evidence, and this essentiality is represented by calling the claim span a nucleus and the evidence span a satellite.

        <rdfs:comment>Implicit discourse connectives (...) are inserted between paragraph-internal adjacent sentence pairs not related explicitly by any of the syntactically-defined set of Explicit connectives. (...) the reader must attempt to infer a discourse relation between the adjacent sentences, and “annotation” consists of inserting a connective expression that best conveys the inferred relation. Connectives inserted in this way to express inferred relations are called Implicit connectives. Multiple discourse relations (Webber et al., 1999) can also be inferred, and are annotated by inserting multiple Implicit connectives.

The goal of annotating Implicit connectives in the PDTB is to capture relations between abstract
objects that are not realized explicitly in the text (by one of a set of the lexically-defined Explicit
connectives) and are left to be inferred by the reader.

        <rdfs:comment>In PDTB: Two kinds of implicit relations are distinguished: ImplicitConnectives (where a connective and an associated relation can be inferred) and EntityRelations (where neither connective nor relation can be inferred but referential coherence is observed). While the former is actually annotated in PDTB, the latter is not, hence no subclass here.

PDTB Entity Relation: no discourse relation can be inferred and where the second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first sentence (akin to entity-based coherence (Knott et al., 2001))

Entity-based coherence captures cases where the implicit relation between adjacent sentences is not between their AO
interpretations, but is rather a form of entity-based coherence (Knott et al., 2001) in which the same
entity is realized in both sentences</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>In interpretation relations, one side of the relation gives a different perspective on the situation presented in the other side. It is subjective, presenting the personal opinion of the writer or of a third party. An interpretation can be: 1) an explanation of what is not immediately plain or explicit; 2) an explanation of actions, events, or statements by pointing out or suggesting inner relationships, motives, or by relating particulars to general principles; or 3) an understanding or appreciation of a situation in light of individual belief, judgment, interest, or circumstance.

        <rdfs:comment>An item comparable to others linked to it by the List relation. (Mann and Taboada 2010)

Arg1 and Arg2 are members of a list, defined in the prior discourse. “List” does not require the situations specified in Arg1 and Arg2 to be directly related. (Prasad et al. 2007)

A LIST is a multinuclear relation whose elements can be listed, but which are not in a comparison, contrast or other, stronger type of multinuclear relation. A LIST relation usually exhibits some sort of parallel structure between the units involved in the relation. At lower levels of the discourse structure, such as between clauses or sentences, a LIST relation is often selected when there is some sort of parallel syntactic or semantic structure between the units, such as in the examples below. At higher levels of the discourse structure, the relation may be found when there are paragraphs of items enumerated in a similar fashion.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

Axiomatization follows SemDok. In particular, we assume that Lists do not follow any natural order, their order thus reflects an (implicit) purpose of the speaker. They are thus interpersonal (presentational) relations.

Note that we skipped the SemDok subclass List-dm_other, as its definition is unclear.</rdfs:comment>

The satellite answers the question “in what manner?” or “in what way?”. A MANNER relation is less “goal-oriented” than a MEANS relation, and often is more of a description of the style of an action.

Language expressions may also depend on the visual, as opposed to verbal, context. An utterance like Could you pass me the salt? , uttered, e.g.,
at a restaurant, is usually understandable even if salt hasn’t been mentioned
before; the recipient can recover the referent of the expression the salt from the visual context. (An even clearer example is Could you please close
the window? .) We will use the term deictic references to refer to these
expressions.

        <rdfs:comment>A markable refers to an element that is subject to annotation. Annotation schemes for coreference annotation *applied to plain text* usually require explicitly defined markables, for example.

The notion of Markable is somewhat problematic in its relation to DiscourseSegment. An RST elementary discourse unit (discourse segment) is basically a markable (almost-arbitrary plain String) together with a label, but an SDRT discourse segment is a structured semantic entity. Here, we remain agnostic. It is thus possible to define a joint subclass of DiscourseSegment and Markable for RST, for example.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>This relation marks a negative attribution. The negation must be in the satel-
lite, or source, of the attribution in order for the ATTRIBUTION-N relation to hold.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

Verbs of attribution are negated on the surface - syntactically (e.g., didn’t say, don’t think) or lexically (e.g., denied), and the negation reverses the polarity of the attributed relation or argument content (Horn, 1978). The interpretation of the contrastive relation denoted by but requires that Arg2 should be interpreted under the scope of negation.

        <rdfs:comment>The scopal polarity feature is annotated on relations and their arguments to identify cases where verbs
of attribution are negated on the surface - syntactically (e.g., didn’t say, don’t think) or lexically (e.g.,
denied), but where the negation in fact reverses the polarity of the attributed relation or argument
content (Horn, 1978). Example (162) illustrates such a case. The but clause entails an interpretation
such as I think it’s not a main consideration, for which the negation must take narrow scope over the
embedded clause rather than the higher clause. In particular, the interpretation of the contrastive
relation denoted by but requires that Arg2 should be interpreted under the scope of negation.
(162) “Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but
I don’t think it’s a main consideration,” he says. (0090)

To capture such entailments with surface negations on attribution verbs, an argument of a connective
is marked “Neg” for scopal polarity when the interpretation of the connective requires the surface
negation to take semantic scope over the lower argument. Thus, in Example (162), scopal polarity is
marked as “Neg” for Arg2.

        <rdfs:comment>Instances of reported speech, both direct and indirect, should be marked for the rhetorical relation of ATTRIBUTION. The satellite is the source of the attribution (a clause containing a reporting verb, or a phrase beginning with according to), and the nucleus is the content of the reported message (which must be in a separate clause). The ATTRIBUTION relation is also used with cognitive predicates, to include feelings, thoughts, hopes, etc.

        <rdfs:comment>PDTB: applied to attributions

Classification of Attribute relations with respect to their "scopal polarity", marked when surface negated attribution reverses the polarity of the attributed AO.
The scopal polarity feature is annotated on relations and their arguments to identify cases where verbs
of attribution are negated on the surface - syntactically (e.g., didn’t say, don’t think) or lexically (e.g.,
denied), but where the negation in fact reverses the polarity of the attributed relation or argument
content (Horn, 1978).

Here, these are represented by an individual that represents the relation, and two properties hasSource and hasTarget that link is with the individuals that actually are connected by this relationship.

Note that "pragmatics" is used in a broad sense as opposed to semantics, hence discourse annotations are in its scope.</rdfs:comment>

This tenet of systemic functional linguistics is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others.</rdfs:comment>

Examples of embedded units that can break up other EDUs include: relative clauses, other nominal postmodifiers, parentheticals, participial clauses, etc. By convention, this relation is always multinuclear.
(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

If a DS has intervening material; the “Same” relation is no coherence relation, but
a “trick” that allows dealing with DSs nested in other DSs. (Wolf et al. 2003)</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A SEQUENCE is a multinuclear list of events presented in chronological order. (Carlson and Marcu 2001)
There is a succession relationship between the situations in the nuclei (Mann and Taboada 2010).

cf. SemDok Sequence. We follow SemDok in assuming that the difference between Sequence and List is that a sequence has a natural (i.e., spatio-temporal) order and is thus an ideational (subject-matter) relation, whereas a list has no such order and is thus compiled and organized for a particular purpose, i.e., interpersonal (presentational) in nature. This is a design decision that may be reconsidered.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>ISO: Functional depenence is an asymmetric relation between a dialogue act with a responsive communicative function (dependent act) and the dialogue act(s) that it responds to (antecedent act).

comment: "functional dependence" is an unfortunate term because both "dependency" and "functional" have very different definitions in linguistic syntax (dependency syntax, functional grammar). As a less ambiguous term, we thus propose "response relation". Moreover, as the difference between feedback and response relations *seems* to be that feedback is unsolicited whereas a response is solicited, this dichothomy is used as a naming pattern, here.</rdfs:comment>

It includes the experiential function and the logical function. The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us ...

        <rdfs:comment>The topic constituent identifies the entity or set of entities under which
the information expressed in the comment constituent should be stored in the CG content.

The notion of topic is best understood as a kind of address or file card which specifies the individual or set about which the remainder of the sentence makes a comment (see Reinhart 1981 for such a concept of topicality). It has no truthconditional effect except that it presupposes the existence of that individual. In this sense, the complement of ‘topic’ is ‘comment,’ which can itself be partitioned into a focused and a backgrounded part. Sentences usually have only one topic, but can also have none, or more than one. Following Jacobs (2001), topics can be aboutness or frame-setting topics, and the means to express a topic in the grammar can be pinpointed rather precisely in terms of which syntactic and intonational preferences the topic displays, at least in an intonation language. However, according to Féry’s theses, none of these properties are definitional for topic. Rather they express preferences as to how a ‘good’ topic has to be realized (see also Jacobs 2001 for a similar view).

        <owl:versionInfo>Introduced as a supercategory for RST-DTB relations topic-shift and topic-drift. Both connect large text spans that were no subject to annotation in PDTB.

Note that C-TED introduced EXPANSION.Progression in an extension of the PDTB 3 schema. As progression in Chinese refers to aspects of topic continuity, this concept, formerly a direct subclass of CoherenceRelation, has been reconceptualized as a subclass of Expansion.</owl:versionInfo>

        <rdfs:comment>The relation TOPIC-DRIFT is used to link large textual spans when the topic
drifts smoothly from the information presented in the first span to the information presented in the
second. The same elements are in focus in both textual units. While this relation may be either
mononuclear or multinuclear, it is usually multinuclear. Only select mononuclear if the relative
size or importance of one of the spans is less significant than that of the other.

        <rdfs:comment>The relation TOPIC-SHIFT is used to link large textual spans when there is a
sharp change in focus going from one segment to the other. The same elements are NOT in focus
in the two spans. While this relation may be either mononuclear or multinuclear, it is usually
multinuclear. Only select mononuclear if the relative size or importance of one of the spans is less
significant than that of the other.

        <rdfs:comment>In the absence of an independent occurrence of attribution on an argument, as for Arg2 of Example (158), a “Null” value for the type on the argument means that it needs to be derived by independent (here, undefined) considerations under the scope of the relation.

(158) When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the State in June 1983, he says Judge O’Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000. (0267)

Note that unlike the “Inh” value of the source feature, “Null” does not indicate inheritance. In a subordinate clause, for example, while the relation denoted by the subordinating conjunction may be asserted, the clause content itself may be “presupposed”, as seems to be the case in (158). However, we found these differences difficult to determine at times, and consequently leave this undefined in the scheme.

        <rdfs:comment>Arg2 describes a situation that did not occur in the past and Arg1 expresses what the consequence would have been if it had.

        <rdfs:comment>Arg2 describes a condition that either does not hold at present. Arg1 describes what would also hold if Arg2 were true. “Unreal present” represents the semantics of conditional relations also known in the lingustic literature as present counterfactuals (Iatridou, 2000). The semantics for “unreal present” is a special case of the semantics for hypothetical. (Prasad et al. 2007)</rdfs:comment>

Comment: Note that "Dependence" implies an ordering here (in analogy with dependency syntax), however, Bunt and Prasad explicitly argue against such an interpretation in their schema (when comparing it with RST nuclearity). As a less ambigous term, we thus introduce the label "feedback relation". Moreover, as the difference between feedback and response relations *seems* to be that feedback is unsolicited whereas a response is solicited, this dichothomy is used as a naming pattern, here.</rdfs:comment>
