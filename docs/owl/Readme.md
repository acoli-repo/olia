# OLiA ontologies (official release page)

This page provides the official release versions of all core, stable and (releasable) experimental ontologies from OLiA.

For general information on OLiA, see the [website](https://acoli-repo.github.io/olia/) 

**DO NOT EDIT** these files directly, they are automatically created from `$ROOT/owl/` (with `$ROOT` being the root directory of the repository, equivalent to https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia).

For more information about how to build and update the public OLiA ontologies, run 

	$> cd $ROOT
	$> make help

Note: Instead of `$ROOT`, use the root directory of your local copy of the the repository.
