    >The basic elementary discourse unit (EDU) is a clause.

The first step in characterizing the discourse structure of a text in our protocol is to determine the
elementary discourse units (EDUs), which are the minimal building blocks of a discourse tree.
Mann and Thompson (1988, p. 244) state that “RST provides a general way to describe the rela-
tions among clauses in a text, whether or not they are grammatically or lexically signalled.”

... we chose the clause as the elementary unit of discourse,
using lexical and syntactic clues to help determine boundaries. A few refinements to this basic
principle are enumerated below, with reference to the section of the manual that discusses the phe-
nomenon in more detail.
• Clauses that are subjects or objects of a main verb are not treated as EDUs. (Section 2.2)
• Clauses that are complements of a main verb are not treated as EDUs. (Section 2.3)
• Complements of attribution verbs (speech acts and other cognitive acts) are treated as EDUs.
(Section 2.4)
• Relative clauses, nominal postmodifiers, or clauses that break up other legitimate EDUs, are
treated as embedded discourse units. (Section 2.9)
• Phrases that begin with a strong discourse marker, such as because, in spite of, as a result of,
according to, are treated as EDUs. (Section 2.10)</rdfs:comment>

BACKGROUND relation is not always specified clearly or delimited sharply. Hence, the CIRCUM-

    >In a consequence relation, the situation presented in one span is a consequence
of the situation presented in the other span. The reader/writer intentions are irrelevant to determin-
ing whether such a relation holds. A CONSEQUENCE-N relation is similar to a RESULT relation, in
that in both cases, the nucleus presents a consequence or result of the situation in the satellite.
Similarly, a CONSEQUENCE-S relation is similar to a CAUSE relation, in that in both cases, the satel-
lite presents a consequence or result of the situation in the nucleus. The relations CAUSE and
RESULT imply a more direct linkage between the events in the nucleus and the satellite, whereas a
CONSEQUENCE-S or CONSEQUENCE-N relation suggests a more indirect linkage. If both spans carry

postmodifier of a noun phrase, that is required to give meaning to an animate or inanimate object.

almost always an embedded unit. This relation is almost always embedded

In embedded units, ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is much more common than
ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E. The way to distinguish between ELABORATION-OBJECT-
ATTRIBUTE-E and ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E is that the former is intrinsic to the object it is
modifying in the nucleus, while the latter is extrinsic, i.e. it contains information that is incidental
and which could be omitted without loss of understanding. Usually, an ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is separated from the nucleus by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative
clause, whereas an ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E represents a restrictive relative clause.</rdfs:comment>
