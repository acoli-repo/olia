    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">DefinitionAdverbs are words that typically modifyverbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify adjectives and other adverbs, as in very briefly or arguably wrong. There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the ADV part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features. Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as verbal particles, as in write down or end up. They are still tagged ADV and not PART. Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our universal tagging scheme. In particular, adverbial ordinal numerals ([cs] poprv√© ‚Äúfor the first time‚Äù) and multiplicative numerals (e.g. once, twice) behave syntactically as adverbs and are tagged ADV. Note that there are verb forms such as transgressives or adverbial participles that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or ADV. Examples very well exactly tomorrow up, down interrogative adverbs: where, when, how, why demonstrative adverbs: here, there, now, then indefinite adverbs: somewhere, sometime, anywhere, anytime totality adverbs: everywhere, always negative adverbs: nowhere, never References Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

What makes them different from punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words. This involves all currency symbols, e.g. $ 75 is identical to seventy-five dollars. Mathematical operators form another group of symbols. Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji. Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not symbols but they may be proper nouns: 130XE, DC10; others may be tagged PROPN (rather than SYM) even if they contain special characters: DC-10. Similarly, abbreviations for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech of the full form. For example, Mr. (mister), kg (kilogram), km (kilometer), Dr (Doctor) should be tagged nouns. Acronyms for proper names such as UN and NATO should be tagged as proper nouns.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.Note that cardinal numerals are covered by NUM whether they are used as determiners or not (as in Windows Seven) and whether they are expressed as words (four), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV). Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers such as many and few) are taggedDET. Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some languages (e.g. Czech) but which are not tagged NUM. Such non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in our universal tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: ordinal numerals are adjectives (first, second, third) or adverbs ([cs] poprv√© ‚Äúfor the first time‚Äù), multiplicative numerals are adverbs (once, twice) etc. Examples 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359 one, two, three, seventy-seven I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV References Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions. Adpositions belong to a closed set of items that occur before (preposition) or after (postposition) a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and that form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.In many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword expressions, such as in spite of, because of, thanks to. The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (in is ADP, spite isNOUN, etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation. Note that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function as verbal particles, as in give in or hold on. They are still tagged ADP and not PART.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.We followLoos et al. 2003 in recognizing these three subclasses as subordinating conjunctions: Complementizers, like [en] that or if Adverbial clause introducers, like [en] when, since, or before (when introducing a clause not a nominal) Relativizers, like [he] ≈°e. (Note that these words, which simply introduce a relative caluse, and normally don‚Äôt inflect, need to be distinguished from relative or resumptive pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and which we analyze as PRON.) For coordinating conjunctions, see CONJ. Examples that as in I believe that he will come. if while References Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">DefinitionParticles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g.adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs). Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation, mood, tense etc. Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur. Note that the PART tag does not cover so-called verbal particles in Germanic languages, as in give in or end up. These are adpositions or adverbs by origin and are tagged accordingly ADP or ADV. Separable verb prefixes in German are treated analogically. Note that not all function words that are traditionally called particles in Japanese automatically qualify for the PART tag. Some of them do, e.g. the question particle „Åã / ka. Others (e.g. „Å´ / ni, „ÅÆ / no) are parallel to adpositions in other languages and should thus be tagged ADP. Examples Possessive marker: [en] ‚Äòs Negation particle: [en] not; [de] nicht Question particle: [ja] „Åã / ka (adding this particle to the end of a clause turns the clause into a question); [tr] mu Sentence modality: [cs] a≈•, k√©≈æ, nech≈• (Let‚Äôs do it!

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">DefinitionPronouns are words that substitute fornouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context. Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that some languages traditionally extend the term pronoun to words that substitute for adjectives. Such words are not tagged PRON under our universal scheme. They are tagged as determiners in order to annotate the same thing the same way across languages. For instance, [en] this is either pronoun (I saw this yesterday.) or determiner (I saw this car yesterday.) Its Czech translation, [cs] tohle, is traditionally called pronoun in Czech grammar, regardless of context (the notion of determiners does not exist in Czech grammar). To make the annotation parallel across languages, it should be now tagged PRON in Tohle jsem vidƒõl vƒçera. and DET in Tohle auto jsem vidƒõl vƒçera. Examples personal pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they reflexive pronouns: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, theirselves demonstrative pronouns: this as in I saw this yesterday. interrogative pronouns: who, what as in What do you think? relative pronouns: who, what as in I wonder what you think.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.Note that PROPN is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties (such as occurring without an article in the singular in English). When other phrases or sentences are used as names, the component words retain their original tags. For example, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cat isNOUN, on is ADP, a is DET, etc. A fine point is that it is not uncommon to regard words that are etymologically adjectives or participles as proper nouns when they appear as part of a multiword name that overall functions like a proper noun, for example in the Yellow Pages, United Airlines or Thrall Manufacturing Company. This is certainly the practice for the English Penn Treebank tag set. Acronyms of proper nouns, such as UN and NATO, should be tagged PROPN. Even if they contain numbers (as in various product names), they are tagged PROPN and not SYM: 130XE, DC10, DC-10. However, if the token consists entirely of digits (like 7 in Windows 7), it is tagged NUM. Examples Mary, John London NATO, HBO References Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">DefinitionDeterminers are words that modifynouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Note that the DET tag includes (pronominal) quantifiers (words like many, few, several), which are included among determiners in some languages but may belong to numerals in others. However, cardinal numerals in the narrow sense (one, five, hundred) are not tagged DET even though some authors would include them in quantifiers. Cardinal numbers have their own tag NUM. Also note that the notion of determiners is unknown in grammars of some languages (e.g. Czech); words equivalent to English determiners may be traditionally classified as pronouns and/or numerals in these languages. In order to annotate the same thing the same way across languages, the words satisfying our definition of determiners should be tagged DET in these languages as well. For instance, [en] this is either pronoun (I saw this yesterday.) or determiner (I saw this car yesterday.) Its Czech translation, [cs] tohle, is traditionally called pronoun in Czech grammar, regardless of context. To make the annotation parallel across languages, it should be now tagged PRON in Tohle jsem vidƒõl vƒçera. and DET in Tohle auto jsem vidƒõl vƒçera. Usually a nominal allows only one DET modifier, but there are occasional cases of addeterminers, which appear outside the usual determiner, such as [en] all in all the children survived. In such cases, both all and the are given the POS DET. Examples articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or givenness): a, an, the possessive determiners: my, your, his, her, its, our, their demonstrative determiners: this as in I saw this car yesterday. interrogative determiners: which as in ‚ÄúWhich car do you like?‚Äù relative determiners: which as in ‚ÄúI wonder which car you like.‚Äù quantity/quantifier determiners: indefinite any, universal: all, and negative no as in ‚ÄúWe have no cars available.‚Äù References Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.Modal verbs may count as auxiliaries in some languages (English). In other languages their behavior is not too different from themain verbs and they are thus tagged VERB. Copulas also stay with main verbs. Note that not all languages have grammaticalized auxiliary verbs, and even where they exist the dividing line between full verbs and auxiliary verbs can be expected to vary between languages. Exactly which verbs are counted as AUX should be part of the language-specific documentation.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-gb">Definition A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.Note that the VERB tag covers main verbs (content verbs) and copulas but it does not cover auxiliary verbs, for which there is theAUX tag. Modal verbs may be considered VERB or AUX, depending on their behavior in the given language. Language-specific documentation should specify which verbs are tagged AUX in which contexts. Note that participles are word forms that may share properties and usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or ADJ. Note that some verb forms such as gerunds and infinitives may share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or NOUN.
