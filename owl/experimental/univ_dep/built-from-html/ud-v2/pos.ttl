Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties
or attributes:

The oldest French bridge

They may also function as predicates, as in:

The car is green.

The ADJ tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See DET for determiners
and NUM for (cardinal) numbers. ADJ is used for “proper adjectives” such as
European.

Numbers vs. Adjectives: In general, cardinal numbers receive the part of speech
NUM, while ordinal numbers (more precisely adjectival ordinal numerals) receive
the tag ADJ.

There are words that may traditionally be called numerals in some languages
(e.g., Czech) but which are treated as adjectives in our universal tagging
scheme. In particular, the adjectival ordinal numerals (note: Czech also has
adverbial ones) behave both morphologically and syntactically as adjectives and
are tagged ADJ.

Nouns vs. Adjectives: A noun modifying another noun to form a compound noun is
given the tag NOUN not ADJ.

Participles: Participles are word forms that may share properties and usage of
any of adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Depending on the language and context,
they may be classified as any of ADJ, NOUN or VERB.

Adjectival modifiers of adjectives: In general, an ADJ is modified by an ADV (
very strong). However, sometimes a word modifying an ADJ is still regarded as
an ADJ. These cases include: (i) ordinal numeral modifiers of a superlative
adjective (the third oldest bridge) and (ii) when a pair of adjectives form a
compound adjectival modifier (an African American mayor).

  • big
  • old
  • green

  • incomprehensible
  • first, second, third

Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions. Adpositions
belong to a closed set of items that occur before (preposition) or after
(postposition) a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause
that functions as a noun phrase, and that form a single structure with the
complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit
within a clause.

In many languages, adpositions can take the form of fixed multiword
expressions, such as in spite of, because of, thanks to. The component words
are then still tagged according to their basic use (in is ADP, spite is NOUN,
etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the
syntactic annotation.

Note that in Germanic languages, some prepositions may also function as verbal
particles, as in give in or hold on. They are still tagged ADP and not PART.

Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time,
place, direction or manner. They may also modify adjectives and other adverbs,
as in very briefly or arguably wrong.

There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in
context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be
categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs
also get the ADV part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional
features.

Note that in Germanic languages, some adverbs may also function as verbal
particles, as in write down or end up. They are still tagged ADV and not PART.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in some
languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adverbs in our universal tagging

adverbs and are tagged ADV.

Note that there are verb forms such as transgressives or adverbial participles
that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on language and

Definition

An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb
phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb,
such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. It is
often a verb (which may have non-auxiliary uses as well) but many languages
have nonverbal TAME markers and these should also be tagged AUX. The class AUX
also include copulas (in the narrow sense of pure linking words for nonverbal
predication).

Modal verbs may count as auxiliaries in some languages (English). In other
languages their behavior is not too different from the main verbs and they are
thus tagged VERB.

Note that not all languages have grammaticalized auxiliaries, and even where
they exist the dividing line between full verbs and auxiliaries can be expected
to vary between languages. Exactly which words are counted as AUX should be
part of the language-specific documentation.

Examples

  • Tense auxiliaries: has (done), is (doing), will (do)
  • Passive auxiliaries: was (done), got (done)
  • Modal auxiliaries: should (do), must (do)

  rdfs:comment """
Definition

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the
reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate
whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class,
to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified
person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc.

Determiners under this definition include both articles and pro-adjectives
(pronominal adjectives), which is a slightly broader sense than what is usually
regarded as determiners in English. In particular, there is no general
requirement that a nominal can be modified by at most one determiner, although
some languages may show a strong tendency towards such a constraint. (For
example, an English nominal usually allows only one DET modifier, but there are
occasional cases of addeterminers, which appear outside the usual determiner,
such as [en] all in all the children survived. In such cases, both all and the
are given the POS DET.)

Note that the DET tag includes (pronominal) quantifiers (words like many, few,
several), which are included among determiners in some languages but may belong
to numerals in others. However, cardinal numerals in the narrow sense (one,
five, hundred) are not tagged DET even though some authors would include them
in quantifiers. Cardinal numbers have their own tag NUM.

Also note that the notion of determiners is unknown in traditional grammar of
some languages (e.g. Czech); words equivalent to English determiners may be
traditionally classified as pronouns and/or numerals in these languages. In
order to annotate the same thing the same way across languages, the words
satisfying our definition of determiners should be tagged DET in these
languages as well.

It is not always crystal clear where pronouns end and determiners start. Unlike
in UD v1 it is no longer required that they are told apart solely on the base
of the context. The words can be pre-classified in the dictionary as either
PRON or DET, based on their typical syntactic distribution (and morphology,
when applicable). Language-specific documentation should list all determiners
(it is a closed class) and point out ambiguities, if any.

See also general principles on pronominal words for more tips on how to define
determiners. In particular:

  • Articles (the, a, an) are always tagged DET; their PronType is Art.
  • Pronominal numerals (quantifiers) are tagged DET; besides PronType, they
    also use the NumType feature.
  • Words that behave similar to adjectives are DET. Similar behavior means:
      □ They are more likely to be used attributively (modifying a noun phrase)
        than substantively (replacing a noun phrase). They may occur alone,
        though. If they do, it is either because of ellipsis, or because the
        hypothetical modified noun is something unspecified and general, as in
        All [visitors] must pay.
      □ Their inflection (if applicable) is similar to that of adjectives, and
        distinct from nouns. They agree with the nouns they modify. Especially
        the ability to inflect for gender is typical for adjectives and
        determiners. (Gender of nouns is determined lexically and determiners
        may be required by the grammar to agree with their nouns in gender;
        therefore they need to inflect for gender.)
  • Possessives vary across languages. In some languages the above tests put
    them in the DET category. In others, they are more like a normal personal
    pronoun in a specific case (often the genitive), or a personal pronoun with
    an adposition; they are tagged PRON.

Examples

  • articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or
    givenness): a, an, the
  • possessive determiners (which modify a nominal): [cs] můj, tvůj, jeho,
    její, náš, váš, jejich; [en] my, your
  • demonstrative determiners: this as in I saw this car yesterday.
  • interrogative determiners: which as in “Which car do you like?”
  • relative determiners: which as in “I wonder which car you like.”
  • quantity determiners (quantifiers): indefinite any, universal: all, and
    negative no as in “We have no cars available.”

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or

determiners or not (as in Windows Seven) and whether they are expressed as

Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or
phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal
parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating
conjunctions or auxiliary verbs). Particles may encode grammatical categories
such as negation, mood, tense etc. Particles are normally not inflected,
although exceptions may occur.

Note that the PART tag does not cover so-called verbal particles in Germanic
languages, as in give in or end up. These are adpositions or adverbs by origin
and are tagged accordingly ADP or ADV. Separable verb prefixes in German are
treated analogically.

Note that not all function words that are traditionally called particles in
Japanese automatically qualify for the PART tag. Some of them do, e.g. the
question particle か / ka. Others (e.g. に / ni, の / no) are parallel to
adpositions in other languages and should thus be tagged ADP.

In general, the PART tag should be used restrictively and only when no other
tag is possible. The the language-specific documentation should list the words
classified as PART in the given language.

Examples

  • Possessive marker: [en] ‘s
  • Negation particle: [en] not; [de] nicht
  • Question particle: [ja] か / ka (adding this particle to the end of a

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of

Note that PROPN is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used as names

an article in the singular in English). When other phrases or sentences are
used as names, the component words retain their original tags. For example, in
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cat is NOUN, on is ADP, a is DET, etc.

A fine point is that it is not uncommon to regard words that are etymologically
adjectives or participles as proper nouns when they appear as part of a
multiword name that overall functions like a proper noun, for example in the
Yellow Pages, United Airlines or Thrall Manufacturing Company. This is
certainly the practice for the English Penn Treebank tag set.

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as UN and NATO, should be tagged PROPN. Even if
they contain numbers (as in various product names), they are tagged PROPN and
not SYM: 130XE, DC10, DC-10. However, if the token consists entirely of digits

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form,

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric characters, similarly to

identical to seventy-five dollars.

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.

Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not symbols but
they may be proper nouns: 130XE, DC10; others may be tagged PROPN (rather than

for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech of the

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events
and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the
number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause. Verbs are
often associated with grammatical categories like tense, mood, aspect and
voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs
or particles.

Note that the VERB tag covers main verbs (content verbs) but it does not cover
auxiliary verbs and verbal copulas (in the narrow sense), for which there is
the AUX tag. Modal verbs may be considered VERB or AUX, depending on their
behavior in the given language. Language-specific documentation should specify
which verbs are tagged AUX in which contexts.

Note that participles are word forms that may share properties and usage of
adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified
as either VERB or ADJ.

Note that some verb forms such as gerunds and infinitives may share properties
and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be

Note that there are verb forms such as converbs (transgressives) or adverbial
participles that share properties and usage of adverbs and verbs. Depending on
