automated UD conversion
-----------------------

history
-------

- May 2015 initial prototype for HTML2OWL conversion developed at EUROLAN-2015 -- CC
- 2016-08-23 prototype for HTML+RDFa generation from Markdown source -- CC
  Note that this converter did not deliver the intended functionality because updates to the Markdown source files were not properly processed by Jekyll, it thus never went productive. Code and Markdown sources available under http://fginter.github.io/docs/, generated HTML+RDFa available under http://fginter.github.io/docs/.
- 2016-2019 consolidation efforts -- CC and CF
- 2019-07-26 HTML2OWL conversion for UD v.1
