# Introduction

The Spanish UD treebank come from the universal Google dataset (version 2.0). It consists of roughly 4,000 sentences and 112,718 tokens taken from newspaper articles, blogs and consumer reviews. The conversion to the UD POS and UD dependencies have been performed automatically, using heuristic rules and fixed lists of words. The output of the conversion has not been manually corrected.

More information about the original Google dataset can be found in the following paper:
