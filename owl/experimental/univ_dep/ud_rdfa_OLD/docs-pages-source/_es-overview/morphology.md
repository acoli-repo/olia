# Morphology

This document is a placeholder for the language-specific overview of
guidelines for part-of-speech tags and features.

Token level morphology features have been added automatically using the parsers/taggers in Bohnet et al. 2013* trained on the Ancora** treebank and converted automatically to UD standards.

Various heuristics have been added to improve the output of the tagger, fix obvious errors and add features that
the tagger did not supply. The changes for v1.2 (November 2015) were done by Miguel Ballesteros, Dan Zeman, and
Héctor Martínez Alonso.

The Spanish UD conforms to the UD guidelines, but there are some exceptions.
