The parataxis relation (from Greek for "place side by side") is a
relation between a word (often the main predicate of a sentence) and other
elements, such as a sentential parenthetical or a clause after a “:” or
a “;”, placed side by side without any explicit
coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. Parataxis is a discourse-like equivalent of coordination, and so usually obeys an iconic ordering. Hence it is normal for the first part of a sentence to be the head and the second part to be the parataxis dependent, regardless of the headedness properties of the language.  But things do get more complicated, such as cases of parentheticals, which appear medially.

## An inventory of constructions to which parataxis has been applied

### Side-by-side sentences ("run-on sentences")

The relation parataxis is used for a pair of what could have been standalone sentences, 
but which are being treated together as a single sentence. This may happen because sentence
segmentation of the sentence was done primarily following the presence of sentence-final punctuation,
and these clauses are joined by punctuation such as a colon or comma, or not delimited by punctuation
at all. In a spoken corpus, it may happen because what is labeled as a sentence is more
commonly an utterance turn. Even if the treebanker is doing the sentence division, it may
happen because there seems to be a clear discourse relation linking two clauses. 
Sometimes there are more than two sentences joined in this way. In this case we make all the later sentences
dependents of the first one, to maximize similarity to the analysis used for conjunction.

Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food to move .
parataxis(hunters, need)
~~~

This relation may happen with units that are smaller than sentences:

~~~ sdparse
Divided world the CIA
amod(world, Divided)
parataxis(world, CIA)
det(CIA, the)

### Treatment of reported speech

For this reported speech example:

~~~ sdparse
The guy , John said , left early in the morning
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

there are paraphrases that convey essentially the same meaning but
with a different syntactic structure. When the reported speech is embedded in a subordinate clause (with or 
without an overt complementizer _that_), the subordinate clause is a [ccomp]() of the speech verb. When the
reported speech follows the speech verb and is separated by a colon, the reported speech forms a main clause
that attaches to the preceding main clause with a [parataxis]() relation, hence with the speech verb as its head.
However, when the speech verb occurs as a medial or final parenthetical, the relation is reversed and the speech
verb is treated as a [parataxis]() of the reported speech. 
This analysis is not uncontroversial but follows many authorities, such as Huddleston and Pullum (2002),
_The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language_ (see chapter 11, section 9). 

~~~ sdparse
John said that the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said the guy left early in the morning .
ccomp(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John said : “ The guy left early in the morning . ”
parataxis(said, left)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
“ The guy left early in the morning ” , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy left early in the morning , John said .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The guy , he said , left early in the morning .
parataxis(left, said)
~~~

An argument for this analysis is that in the cases analyzed as embedding, the entire clause
can be further embedded (_I was taken aback when John said the guy left early in the morning._),
while this is not possible with medial or final placement of the speech verb 
(_*I was taken aback when the guy left early this morning, John said._).

### News article bylines

We have used the parataxis relation to connect the parts of a news article byline. 
There does not seem to be a better relation to use.

~~~ sdparse
Washington ( CNN ) :
parataxis(Washington, CNN)
~~~

### Interjected clauses

Single word or phrase interjections are analyzed as [discourse](), but when a whole clause is interjected, we use the relation parataxis.

~~~ sdparse
Calafia has great fries ( they are to die for ! )
parataxis(has, are)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Just to let you all know Matt has confirmed the booking for 3rd Dec is OK .
parataxis(confirmed, let)
~~~

In the second example, we treat the second half as the head of the dependency
because the first half feels like a whole clause interjection, not like the main clause of the utterance.
