A marker is the word introducing a finite clause subordinate to
another clause. For a [complement clause](ccomp), this will typically be _that_
or _whether._ For an [adverbial clause](advcl), the marker is typically a
[subordinating conjunction](../pos/SCONJ) like _while_ or _although._ The mark is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head.
