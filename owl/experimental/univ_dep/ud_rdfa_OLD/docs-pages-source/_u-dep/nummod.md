A numeric modifier of a noun is any [number](u-pos/NUM) phrase
that serves to modify the meaning of the noun with a quantity.

~~~ sdparse
Sam ate 3 sheep
nummod(sheep, 3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sam spent forty dollars
nummod(dollars, forty)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sam spent $ 40
nummod($, 40)
~~~

Note that indefinite quantifiers such as _few, many_ are tagged
[u-pos/DET]() rather than [u-pos/NUM](). 
Therefore their relation to the quantified noun is not `nummod` but
[det]():

~~~ sdparse
Sam ate many sheep
det(sheep, many)
~~~
