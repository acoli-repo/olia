title: 'case'
shortdef: 'case marking'

The `case` relation is used for any case-marking element which is treated as a separate syntactic word (including prepositions, postpositions, and clitic case markers). Case-marking elements are treated as dependents of the noun or clause they attach to or introduce. (Thus, contrary to SD, UD abandons treating a preposition as a mediator between a modified word and its object.) The `case` relation aims at providing a more uniform analysis of nominal elements, prepositions and case in morphologically rich languages: a nominal in an oblique case will receive the same dependency structure as a nominal introduced by an adposition.

When case markers are morphemes, they are not divided off the noun as a separate case dependent,
but the noun as a whole is analyzed as a [nmod]() of the verb.
To overtly mark case,
<a href="../pos/index.html">POS tags</a> and
<a href="../feat/index.html">features</a>
are included in the representation as shown below on a Russian example
(put your mouse pointer over the words to see additional morphosyntactic features).

This treatment provides parallelism between different constructions
across and within languages. A good result is that we now have greater
parallelism between prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses,
which are often introduced by a preposition in some languages:

~~~ sdparse
Sue left after the rehearsal
nsubj(left-2, Sue-1)
nmod(left-2, rehearsal-5)
det(rehearsal-5, the-4)
case(rehearsal-5, after-3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Sue left after we did
nsubj(left-2, Sue-1)
advcl(left-2, did-5)
mark(did-5, after-3)
nsubj(did-5, we-4)
~~~

We also obtain parallel constructions for


- the possessive alternation

~~~ sdparse
the Chair 's office
det(Chair-2, the-1)
nmod(office-4, Chair-2)
case(Chair-2, 's-3)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
the office of the Chair
det(office-2, the-1)
nmod(office-2, Chair-5)
case(Chair-5, of-3)
det(Chair-5, the-4)
~~~

postposition in Finnish

- the dative alternation where the prepositional construction gets a similar
analysis to the double object construction

Another advantage of this new analysis is that it provides a treatment
of prepositional phrases that are predicative complements of "be" that is consistent with the treatment of nominal predicative
complements:

~~~ sdparse
Sue is in shape
nsubj(shape-4, Sue-1)
cop(shape-4, is-2)
case(shape-4, in-3)
~~~

When prepositions are stacked (that is, there is a sequence of prepositions), there are two possible analyses. If the sequence is a frozen combination with a specific meaning, then the best analysis is as an `mwe`. An English example of this is *out of*:

~~~ sdparse
Out of all this , something good will come .
case(this-4, Out-1)
mwe(Out-1, of-2)
det(this-4, all-3)
nmod(come, this-4)
~~~

However, if various combinations of prepositions can be used to express different meaning combinations or nuances, then  each preposition is independently analyzed as a case dependent. Examples of this in English include *up beside* (which can alternate with *down beside* or *up near*) or *except during* which can alternate with *as during* or *except after*:

~~~ sdparse
The cafe up beside the lookout
det(cafe-2, The-1)
case(lookout-6, up-3)
case(lookout-6, beside-4)
det(lookout-6, the-5)
nmod(cafe-2, lookout-6)
