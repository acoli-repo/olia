title: 'acl'
shortdef: 'clausal modifier of noun (adjectival clause)'
---

`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal.  The `acl` relation 
contrasts with the [advcl]() relation, which is used for adverbial clauses
that modify a predicate. The head of the `acl` relation is the noun
that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that
modifies the noun.

Cette affaire Ã  suivre \n This case to follow 
acl(affaire, suivre)

This relation is also used for optional depictives. The adjective is taken to modify the nominal of which it provides a secondary predication. See [xcomp]() for further discussion of resultatives and depictives.

A relative clause is an instance of `acl`, characterized by finiteness and usually omission of 
the modified noun in the embedded clause. Some languages use a language-particular subtype for the traditional class of relative clauses.

~~~ sdparse
I saw the man you love
acl(man, love)
~~~

Some languages allow finite clausal complements for nouns with 
a subset of nouns like *fact* or *report*. These look roughly like relative clauses, but do not have any omitted role in the dependent clause. This is the class of "content
clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). These are also analyzed as `acl`.
