For more on coordination, see the [conj]() relation.
A `cc` is the relation between the first conjunct and
the [coordinating conjunction](../pos/CONJ) delimiting another conjunct.
(Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of coordination.
We take the first conjunct as the head of the coordination.)

~~~ sdparse
Bill is big and honest
cc(big, and)
~~~

A coordinating conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a
sentence. This is also called a `cc`, and it depends on the root
predicate of the sentence.
(In fact there is a coordination that spans multiple sentences.
We cannot attach a word to the first conjunct because it is in another sentence.
Thus we attach it to the first conjunct available in the current sentence: its main predicate.)

~~~ sdparse
And then we left .
cc(left, And)
~~~

<div id="punct1" class="sd-parse">
We have apples , pears , oranges , and bananas .
dobj(have, apples)
conj(apples, pears)
conj(apples, oranges)
conj(apples, bananas)
cc(apples, and)
punct(apples, ,-4)
punct(apples, ,-6)
punct(apples, ,-8)
</div>
