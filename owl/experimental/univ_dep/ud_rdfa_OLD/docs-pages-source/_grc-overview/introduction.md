# Introduction

Ancient Greek is here defined as the Greek language from the first attested texts to 1453.

The Ancient Greek UD treebank is based on the
[Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 1.2](http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/) (AGDT),
created in the Perseus Project.
The treebank consists of 21,173 sentences (309 K tokens) and it contains texts by Homer (8th
century BC), Hesiod (8th-7th century BC), Aeschylus (525-456 BC) and Sophocles (497-405 BC).

The treebank is licensed under the terms of
[CC BY-NC-SA 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/).

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Ancient Greek UD treebank is created through
a conversion of the AGDT data. The conversion procedure was designed by Dan Zeman.

## Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the contributors to the original AGDT annotation effort.
