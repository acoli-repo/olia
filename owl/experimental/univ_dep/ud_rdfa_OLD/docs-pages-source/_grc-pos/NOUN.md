### Definition

A noun can be defined in Ancient Greek as the PoS inflecting for case, number, and (typically one) gender. Some adjectives might be confused with nouns, they being very often used as substantivized adjectives (e.g., Ἀθηναῖος). In general, the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?redirect=true" target="_blank">LSJ</a> should be used if doubt arises.

#### Examples

* _λογεύς_, _έως_, _ὁ_, "speaker"
* _λῆμμα_, _ατος_, _τό_, "anything received"
* _ὕδωρ_,  _ὕδατος_, _τό_, "water"
