### Definition

Adverbs can be morphologically defined as a set of words whose form is fixed. A number of adverbs were originally nouns in a certain case (see, for example, the adverbial accusative in Smyth 1920: <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Smyth+grammar+1606&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007" target="_blank">361</a>). 

Syntactically, adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Adverbs have to be distinguished from particles, even though the criteria for such distinction are not always clear-cut (see definition for <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_grc-pos/PART.md" target="_blank">PART</a>). 

#### Examples

* _σοφῶς_ "wisely"
* _ὁμόσε_ "to the same place"
* _πῶς_ "how?"
