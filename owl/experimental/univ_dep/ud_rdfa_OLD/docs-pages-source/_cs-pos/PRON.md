### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases,
whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic
context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that
Czech grammar traditionally extends the term _pronoun_ to words that
substitute for [adjectives](ADJ). Such words are not tagged `PRON`
under our universal scheme. They are tagged as [determiners](DET) in
order to annotate the same thing same way across languages.

For instance, _tohle&nbsp;_ “this” is traditionally called pronoun in
Czech grammar, regardless of context (the notion of determiners does
not exist in Czech grammar). To make the annotation parallel across
languages, it should be now tagged `PRON` in _<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl
včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.” and `DET` in
_<b>Tohle</b> auto jsem viděl včera.&nbsp;_ “I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.”

### Examples

- personal pronouns: _já, ty, on, ona, ono, my, vy, oni, ony&nbsp;_ “I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they, they”
- reflexive pronouns: _sebe, se, sobě, si, sebou&nbsp;_ “oneself”
- demonstrative pronouns: _tohle&nbsp;_ as in _<b>Tohle</b> jsem viděl včera._ “I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.”
- interrogative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _<b>Co</b> si myslíš?&nbsp;_ “<b>What</b> do you think?”
- relative pronouns: _kdo, co&nbsp;_ “who, what” as in _Zajímalo by mě, <b>co</b> si myslíš.&nbsp;_  “I wonder <b>what</b> you think.”
- indefinite pronouns: _někdo, něco&nbsp;_ “somebody, something”
- total pronouns: _každý, všichni&nbsp;_ “everybody, all”
- negative pronouns: _nikdo, nic&nbsp;_ “nobody, nothing”
