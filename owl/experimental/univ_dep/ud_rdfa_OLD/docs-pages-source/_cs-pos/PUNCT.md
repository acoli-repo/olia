### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups
used to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and
_ยง_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

### Examples

- Period: _<b>.</b>_
- Comma: _<b>,</b>_
- Parentheses: _<b>()</b>_

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT texts are from the early 1990s and there are no e-mail addresses.
If they were there, the PDT tokenization rules would break them up on all dots and at signs.
The same holds for telephone numbers. For example,
_tel.: (05) 4321 6014&nbsp;_ is analyzed as eight tokens (`NOUN PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT NUM PUNCT NUM NUM`).
