### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

A special usage of `X` is for cases of code-switching where it is not
possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language
grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis).
This rarely applies to the PDT data where many foreign words are tagged with their original
part of speech.

Even if foreign words are tagged `X`, this usage does not extend
to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal
part-of-speech. For example, in _Skotové nosí kilt&nbsp;_ “Scots wear kilts”,
_kilt_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

### Examples

- _A on pak akorát <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>&nbsp;_ “And then he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>”
