### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for
proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Czech nouns have the lexical feature [cs-feat/Gender]().
Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [cs-feat/Number]() and [cs-feat/Case]().

A verbal noun can be derived productively from almost every verb
(e.g. _dělat_&nbsp; “to do” → _dělání_&nbsp; “doing”).
While in other languages a corresponding form may be called gerund and tagged [VERB](),
in Czech it is tagged `NOUN`. It has always the neuter gender and the full
number-case inflectional paradigm.

### Examples

- _dívka_&nbsp; “girl”
- _kočka_&nbsp; “cat”
- _strom_&nbsp; “tree”
- _vzduch_&nbsp; “air”
- _krása_&nbsp; “beauty”
- _plavání_&nbsp; “swimming”
