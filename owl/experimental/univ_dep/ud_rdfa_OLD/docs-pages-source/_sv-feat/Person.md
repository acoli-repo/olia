Swedish [verbs](sv-pos/VERB) do not inflect for `Person`. Certain personal and possessive
pronouns can be considered to have `Person` as a feature. However, in Swedish this is always
completely unambiguous given the word form. The `Person` feature is not currently used in the 
Swedish treebank. For further discussion of `Person` see the universal depency page ([u-feat/person]()).
