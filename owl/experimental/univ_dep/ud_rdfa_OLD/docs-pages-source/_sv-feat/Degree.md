Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](sv-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](sv-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without
comparing it to qualities of others.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>vanlig</b> karakteristik_ "normal characteristic"
* [sv] _<b>naturliga</b> resurser_ "natural resources"

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one thing is compared to the same quality of another.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>färre</b> barn_ "fewer children"
* [sv] _att röka <b>mindre</b>_ "to smoke less"

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one thing is compared to the same quality of all other
things within a set.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>längst</b> till höger_ "furthest to the right"
* [sv] _<b>största</b> valdistriktet_ "largest constituency"
