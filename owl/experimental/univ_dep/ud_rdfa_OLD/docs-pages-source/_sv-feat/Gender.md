Gender is a lexical feature of nouns and an inflectional feature
of other parts of speech (adjectives, determiners) that mark agreement with
nouns. 

### `Com`: common gender

Swedish does not distinguish masculine/feminine most of the time but does distinguish neuter vs. non-neuter (neutrum/utrum). The non-neuter is called common gender.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>en ogift mor</b>_ "an unmarried mother"
* [sv] _<b>anmälan</b> blir <b>ifylld</b>_ "the report is filled in"

### `Neut`: neuter gender

Nouns and other parts of speech that are neither masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>fullt bostadstillägg</b>_ "full housing supplement"
* [sv] _<b>det</b> första <b>kravet</b>_ "the first <b>requirement"

### `Masc`: masculine gender

Some adjectives, when referring specifically to a male person, take a masculine form in Swedish.

#### Examples

* [sv] _den <b>arbetslöse</b>_ "the unemployed (man)"
* [sv] _den <b>brittiske</b> författaren_ "the British author"
