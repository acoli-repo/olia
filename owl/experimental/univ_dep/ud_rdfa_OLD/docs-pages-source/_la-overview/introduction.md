# Introduction

The Latin UD treebank is based on the
[Latin Dependency Treebank 1.5](http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/) (LDT),
created in the Perseus Project.
The treebank consists of 3,473 sentences (53 K tokens) and it contains texts by Caesar (100–44 BC), Cicero (106–43 BC), Gaius Sallustius Crispus (86–35 BC), Vergilius (70–19 BC), Sextus Propertius (47–15 BC), Ovidius (43 BC – 17), Petronius Arbiter (27–66) and Vulgata by St. Hieronymus (347–420).

The treebank is licensed under the terms of
[CC BY-NC-SA 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/).

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the Latin UD treebank is created through
a conversion of the LDT data. The conversion procedure was designed by Dan Zeman.

## Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the contributors to the original LDT annotation effort.
