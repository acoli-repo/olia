Verbs typically inflect for [tense](Tense), [mood](Mood) and
[person](Person) and signal events and actions. Verbs can constitute a
minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of
other constituents which may occur in the clause.

Auxiliary and modal verbs are not annotated as `VERB` but rather
[AUX]().
