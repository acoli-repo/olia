An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Finnish modal verbs are counted as auxiliaries. Finnish auxiliary and
modal verbs are

* _täytyä_ "must"
* _pitää_ "have to"
* _tarvita_ "need"
* _joutua_ "have to"
* _voida_ "be able to, can"
* _saattaa_ "may"
* _taitaa_ "be+probably, may"
* _mahtaa_ "be+probably, may"
* _olla_ "be"
* _aikoa_ "be going to"

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>täytyy</b> tehdä_ "<b>must</b> do"
* [fi] _<b>olemme</b> tehneet_ "we <b>have</b> done"
* [fi] _<b>olisi pitänyt</b> tehdä_ "<b>would have had</b> to do"
