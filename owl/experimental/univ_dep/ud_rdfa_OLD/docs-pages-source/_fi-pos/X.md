The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

Foreign words appearing inside native text are tagged `X` (see also
[Foreign]()).

#### Examples

* [fi] _Uskoo ken <b>tahtsssszzt brrrzzzt</b>._
* [fi] _Opimme fyysikoiden "<b>Let's assume a spherical cow</b>" -l√§hestymistavan._
