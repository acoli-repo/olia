# Introduction

The UD Tamil treebank is based on the Tamil Dependency Treebank created at the
Charles University in Prague by Loganathan Ramasamy. The treebank was part of
HamleDT, a collection of treebanks converted to the Prague dependency style
(since 2011). Later versions of HamleDT added a conversion to the Stanford
dependencies (2014) and to Universal Dependencies (HamleDT 3.0, 2015). The
first release of Universal Dependencies that includes this treebank is UD v1.2
in November 2015. It is essentially the HamleDT conversion but the data is not
identical to HamleDT 3.0 because the conversion procedure has been further
improved.
