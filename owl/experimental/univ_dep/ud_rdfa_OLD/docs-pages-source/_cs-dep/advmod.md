An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) [adverb](cs-pos/ADV)
or adverbial phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the word.

Note that in the Czech grammatical tradition, the term _adverbial modifier_ covers
constituents that function like adverbs regardless whether they are realized
by adverbs, adpositional phrases, or nouns in particular morphological 
[cases](cs-feat/Case).
We differentiate adverbials realized as adverbs (`advmod`) and
adverbials realized by noun phrases or adpositional phrases
([nmod]()).
