### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(four)_, or digits _(4)_.

There are numerals belonging to other parts of speech in the universal
tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: e.g. ordinal numerals
are tagged as [adjectives](ADJ) or [pronouns](PRON) _(first, second, third, ...)_. 
In Italian there are no adverbial numerals like [cs] _poprvé_ "for the first time" nor multiplicative numerals such as [en] _(once, twice)_.

Note that, since Roman numerals _(IV)_ are only used as ordinal numerals in Italian (Enciclopedia Treccani), are tagged [ADJ]() for coherence with other ordinal numerals. 
In this case we specify `NumType=Ord` as morphological feature. 
A similar treatment is reserved to a cardinal with a suffix such as *a*, *o*, *esimo*, *esima*, or the symbol *°* (similar to the English use of the suffix "th").

Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers such as _many_ and _few_) are tagged [DET]().

### Examples

- _0_, _1_, _2_, _2014_, _1000000_, _3,14159265359_

Tagged as [ADJ]():

- _<b>XX</b> secolo_ 
- _48esimo_
- _primo_, _secondo_, _ultima_
- _20°_

- _il terzo ad arrivare_ "the third to arrive"
