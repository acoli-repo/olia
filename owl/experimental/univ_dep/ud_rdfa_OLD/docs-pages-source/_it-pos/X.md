### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

Note that the universal guidelines recommend the usage of `X` for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis). The PoS tag for Italian in such cases is SW (foreign noun) and is mapped into `X` in the conversion.

This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words where it is assigned a normal
part-of-speech. 

### Examples

* <b>tout court</b>
* <b>res nullius</b>
* <b>pro capite</b>
