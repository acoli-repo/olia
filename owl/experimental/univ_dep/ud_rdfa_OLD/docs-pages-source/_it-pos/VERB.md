### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words typically denoting events and actions, constituting a minimal predicate in a clause, governing the number and types of dependents which may occur in the clause. In Italian verbs are associated with the following grammatical categories: tense, mood and voice, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxilliary verbs or particles.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs (content verbs) and copulas but it does not cover auxiliary verbs, for which the [AUX]() tag is used. 

Participles used as adjectives are classified as [ADJ]().
