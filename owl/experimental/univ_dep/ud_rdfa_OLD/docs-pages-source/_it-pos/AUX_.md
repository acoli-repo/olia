### Definition

Italian auxiliary verbs can be divided into:

- tense auxiliaries, used to form compound tenses represented by _avere_ "to have" and _essere_ "to be";
- passive auxiliaries, used to form passive verb forms represented by _essere_ "to be" and _venire_ lit. "to come".

Following the UD guidelines, Italian modal verbs are handled as modal auxiliaries (e.g. _potere_ "can", _dovere_ "must").
