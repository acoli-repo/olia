### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

We recognize these two subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, _come_ "like", _che_ "that", _mentre_ "while", _se_ "if"
* Adverbial clause introducers, _come_ "like", _quando_ "when", _poiché, perché_ "since", or _prima_ "before" (when introducing a clause not a nominal)

For _coordinating conjunctions_ see [CONJ]().

### Examples

- _Credo <b>che</b> verrà._ "I believe that he will come" 
- _È successo <b>mentre</b> ero al lavoro._ "It happened while I was at work"
- _Vado a casa <b>prima che</b> piova._ "I go home before it starts raining"
