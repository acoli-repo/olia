An interjection is a form, typically brief, which is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as: _sì_ "yes" and _no_ "no". Note that uses of _sì_ and _no_ syntactically related to other accompanying expressions in a sentence are recognized as [ADV]().
