# Specific constructions

Light verb constructions

For light verb constructions, we introduced the additional label lvc, which is appended to the normal dependency relation like dobj:lvc, nsubj:lvc etc.

Multiword named entities and numbers

For multiword named entities and numbers, we apply the name and compound relations, respectively. As opposed to the universal principles, the last element is treated as the head and all the previous tokens are attached to the next one with the given relation. This is because in Hungarian, it is always the last element of multiword units that gets inflected hence it is considered the head.
