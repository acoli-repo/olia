### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Swedish auxiliary verbs can be divided into tense auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries, passive auxiliaries, and copulas.

### Examples

- Tense auxiliary: _<b>har</b> gjort_ "<b>has</b> done", _<b>kommer (att)</b> göra_ "is going to do", _<b>hade</b> gjort_ "hade done"
- Modal auxiliary: _<b>måste</b> skapa_ "must create", _<b>bör</b> leda till_ "should lead to"
- Passive auxiliary: _<b>blev</b> tvungen_ "was forced", _<b>blir</b> skalad_ "is peeled"
- Copula: _<b>är</b> sjuk_ "is sick", _<b>var</b> en idiot_ "was an idiot"

### Delimitation

The exact delimitation of auxiliaries in Swedish is not completely clear-cut, especially for the category of modal auxiliaries and copulas. In the Swedish UD treebank, we have adopted a consensus solution based on existing Swedish grammars, the original Talbanken annotation, and the universal UD guidelines. Below we list the verbs that may appear in each group:

- Tense auxiliary: _har_, _komma_
- Modal auxiliary: _böra_, _kunna_, _måste_, _skola_, _vilja_, _må_, _torde_, _lär_, _få_, _behöva_
- Passive auxiliary: _bli_
- Copula: _vara_
