### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically
signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a
clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause. 

The tag VERB is reserved for full lexical verbs, while auxiliary verbs are tagged [AUX]().
