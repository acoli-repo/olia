### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [adjectives](ADJ),
[verbs](VERB) or other adverbs for such categories as time, place,
direction or manner.

Note that in Swedish, some adverbs may also function as
verbal particles, as in _se <b>ut</b>_ "look" or _gömma <b>undan</b>_ "hide away".  They
are still tagged `ADV` and not [PART]().

### Examples

- _<b>mycket</b> brådskande_ "<b>very</b> urgent"
- _samtidigt_ "simultaneously"
- _det är <b>bara</b>_ "it is <b>only</b>"
