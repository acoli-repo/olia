Lexical feature of verbs.
Some tagsets distinguish intransitive and transitive verbs.
In many languages however, subcategorization of verbs is much more complex than this.

### Intr: intransitive verb

A verb that does not take arguments other than the subject.

Examples:
[en] _to <b>go</b>_

### Tran: transitive verb

A verb that takes a direct (accusative) object as argument (in addition to the subject).
These verbs can be passivized, then the direct object becomes the subject.

Examples:
[en] _to <b>do</b> something, to be <b>done</b> by somebody_
