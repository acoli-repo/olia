Feature of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Is the number expressed by
digits or as a word? This feature appears in 10+ tagsets that I
studied. Note that it is a bit Euro-centric because it distinguishes
(in some tagsets) (Euro)Arabic digits and Roman numerals, but what
about digits in various other scripts? In texts in many Indian scripts
and in the Arabic script both native digits and Euro-Arabic digits can
appear (e.g. 2014 vs. २०१४ in Devanagari).

### Word: number expressed as word

Examples: one, two, three

### Digit: number expressed using digits

Examples: 1, 2, 3

### Roman: roman numeral

Examples: I, II, III
