shortdef: 'hyphenated compound or part of it'

Boolean feature. Is this part of a hyphenated compound? Depending on
tokenization, the compound may be one token or be split to several
tokens; then the tokens need tags.

### Yes: it is part of hyphenated compound

Examples: "anglo-" in "anglo-saxon"; [cs] "česko-slovenský"
(Czecho-Slovak; the second part is a normal adjective, including
adjectival morphological paradigm, but the first part is special.)
