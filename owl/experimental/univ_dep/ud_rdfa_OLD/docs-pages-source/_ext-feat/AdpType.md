### Prep: preposition

Examples: in, on, to, from

### Post: postposition

Examples: German "entlang" in "der Strasse entlang" (along the street)

### Circ: circumposition

Examples: German "von â€¦ an" in "von dieser Stelle an" (from this place
on)

### Voc: vocalized preposition

In Slavic languages, some prepositions are non-syllabic and their form
has to be changed in some contexts to facilitate pronunciation.

Czech examples: ke, ku, se, ve, ze

(Non-vocalized equivalents are: k, k, s, v, z)

Same phenomenon exists in Slovak, Russian and probably elsewhere.
