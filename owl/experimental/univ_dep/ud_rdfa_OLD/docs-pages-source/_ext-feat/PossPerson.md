PossPerson
is possessor's person, marked e.g. on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

Note
that there is currently a sort of inconsitency in Interset: since
this feature was introduced, it would be logical to use it also for
possessive pronouns in other languages. Yet the possessor's person of
these pronouns is traditionally captured in the &ldquo;Person&rdquo;
feature. Also note that using PossPerson for possessive pronouns
might introduce inconsistency at the other end because in some
languages, possessive pronouns are actually identical to personal
pronouns in the genitive case.
