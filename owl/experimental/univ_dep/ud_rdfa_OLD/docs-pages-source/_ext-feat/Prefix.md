Boolean feature. Is this a prefix word in a compound, that usually cannot stand on its own?

These are words corresponding to prefixes such `inter-` (inter disciplinary), `post-` (post traumatic), `un-` (un avoidable), `di-` (di transitive) and so on in English, but which are 
relized as distinct tokens (without the hyphen) in different languages.

### Yes: it is a prefix of a compound
