Personal pronouns in some languages
have different forms depending on whether they are objects of
prepositions or not. For instance, Czech <I>on</I>
(he) without prepositions has the forms <I>jemu</I>/DAT, <I>jeho</I>/ACC,
<I>jím</I>/INS, while with a preposition it is <I>němu</I>/DAT,
<I>něho</I>/ACC, <I>ním</I>/INS. Similarly, Portuguese pronouns in
prepositional oblique case take forms different from oblique pronouns
serving as direct objects of verbs: <I>eu</I>/NOM (I), <I>me</I>/ACC
(give me that), <I>mim</I>/PREP-ACC (come to me).

Default empty value means that the word form is neutral w.r.t.
prepositions.

### Npr: non-prepositional case

This
word form must not be used after a preposition.

Examples:
[cs]
<span style='color: red'><I>jemu</I></span>
= him (dative).

### Pre: prepositional case

This
word form must be used after a preposition.

Examples:
[cs]
<I>k
</I><span style='color: red'><I>ně</I></span><span style='color: red'><I>mu</I></span>
= to
him (dative).
