Boolean feature. Is this a foreign word? Not a loan word and not a
foreign name but a genuinely foreign word appearing inside native
text, e.g. inside direct speech, titles of books etc. This feature
would apply either to the "X" part of speech (unanalyzable token), or
to other parts of speech if we know and are willing to annotate the
class to which the word belongs in its original language.

### Foreign: it is foreign

Example: _He said I could "<b>dra åt helvete!</b>"_

### Fscript: it is foreign and written in a foreign script

Example: _In Nepali, the mountain is called <b>सगरमाथा</b>._

### Tscript: it is foreign and transcribed from a foreign script

Example: _The above Nepali word can be transcribed <b>Sagaramāthā</b>._
