shortdef: 'adverb type'
---

Semantic subclasses of adverbs. They are annotated in some tagsets
(e.g. Bulgarian, Czech, Hindi, Japanese) and would probably apply to
many other languages if their tagsets cared to cover them. Note that
the "prontype" feature also applies to some adverbs and is orthogonal
to "AdvType".

### Man: adverb of manner ("how")

### Loc: adverb of location ("where, where to, where from")

### Tim: adverb of time ("when, since when, till when")

### Deg: adverb of quantity or degree ("how much")

Note that there is a fuzzy borderline between adverbs of degree and
indefinite numerals (as they are called in some grammars). This has
not yet been solved in Interset.

### Cau: adverb of cause ("why")

### Mod: adverb of modal nature

The Czech examples below are similar to modal verbs: they take
infinitives as arguments and add the meaning of possibility, necessity
or recommendedness. I suspect that the Bulgarian example
(transliteration of French "à propos") is used differently but its
native tagset also calles it "modal".

Examples: [bg] апропо, [cs] možno, nutno, radno, třeba

### Sta: adverb of state

Note that while the English translations of the Czech examples below
might hint that they are adjectives, morphologically and syntactically
they are adverbs (and some of them ambiguous with nouns).

Examples: [cs] plno (full), zima (cold), chyba (wrong), škoda (pity),
volno (available), nanic (no good)

Finally, Interset also has two values of "AdvType" that somewhat
deviate from the rest. I do not know what exactly should be done with
them but I had to distinguish them somehow.

### Ex: existential "there" in English

What part of speech is this "there" in the universal parts of speech?

### Adadj: ad-adjective in Finnish

Derived from adjectives, used only to modify other adjectives
