We use `foreign` to label sequences of foreign words. These are given
a linear analysis: the head is the first token in the foreign phrase.

`foreign` does not apply to words transliterated to the Greek script, 
loanwords or to foreign [names](name). It applies to quoted foreign text 
incorporated in a sentence/discourse of the host language (unless we want 
to and know how to annotate the internal structure according 
to the syntax of the foreign language).
