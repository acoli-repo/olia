`acl` is used for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a
noun. Note that in English relative clauses get assigned a specific
relation [acl:relcl](), a subtype of `acl`.

Non-relative clause finite clausal complements for nouns are limited to complement clauses with a subset of nouns like *fact* or *report*.  We analyze them as `acl` (parallel to the analysis of this class as "content clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Such clausal complements are usually finite (though there are occasional remnant English subjunctives).

acl(fact, honest)
