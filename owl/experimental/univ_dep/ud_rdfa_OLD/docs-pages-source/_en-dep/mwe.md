shortdef : 'multi-word expression'
---

The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions with function words that behave like a single function word. Multiword expressions are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure,
in which all words in the expression modify the first one using the
`mwe` label.

At present, this relation is used inside the following expressions:
