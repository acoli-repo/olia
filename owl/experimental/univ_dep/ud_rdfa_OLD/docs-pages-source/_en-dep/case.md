The `case` relation is used for any preposition in English. Prepositions are treated as dependents of the noun they attach to or introduce in an "extended nominal projection". Thus, contrary to SD, UD abandons treating a preposition as a mediator between a modified word and its object. The `case` relation aims at providing a uniform analysis of prepositions and case in morphologically rich languages. In English, subordinating conjunctions introducing clauses are often in the form of prepositions. However, they are given a different dependency: The relation [mark]() is used for markers in an "extended clausal projection".

The `case` relation is also used for the possessive clitic _'s_ in English, which we separate from what it modifies, because it acts as a phrasal clitic, as shown in the last example.
