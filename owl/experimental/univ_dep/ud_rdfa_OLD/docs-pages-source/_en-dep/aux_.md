An auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause, e.g., a
modal auxiliary, or a form of *be*, *do* or *have* in a periphrastic
tense. 

(Contrary to the older SD and arguments of Pullum (1982) and following,
infinitive *to* is not analyzed as an auxiliary. Instead, it is analyzed
as a [mark]().)

aux(died-3, has-2)

~~~ sdparse
