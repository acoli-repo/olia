This document is a placeholder for the language-specific documentation
for `dobj`.


The direct object of a verb is the noun phrase that denotes the entity acted upon.
The direct object in Bulgarian corresponds to the position of the "Accusative" case, 
since nominals in Bulgarian do not have declension.

Accusative example:

~~~ sdparse
Купувам му къща . \n Buy-I him house .
dobj(Купувам, къща)
dobj(Buy-I, house)
~~~
