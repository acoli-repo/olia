# Morphology

The morphological annotation in the Swedish UD treebank follows the general guidelines and does not add any language-specific features. The language-specific tags (including features) follow the guidelines of the Stockholm-Umeå Corpus.

The mapping from language-specific tags and features to universal tags and features was done automatically. We are not aware of any remaining errors or inconsistences but the mapping has not been validated manually. 

Lemmas were assigned using SALDO (Borin et al., 2008) in combination with the language-specific SUC tags. Cases of remaining ambiguity were resolved heuristically, which may have introduced errors. For words and symbols not covered by SALDO, lemmas were added manually.
