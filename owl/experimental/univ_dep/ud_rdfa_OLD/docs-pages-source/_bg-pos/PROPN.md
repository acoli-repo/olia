### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

The tag`PROPN` maps to the following tags in the BulTreeBank scheme: `Np#`, `H#`
The tag `Np#` refers to proper nouns, while the tag `H#` handles two cases: 1. family names, which are
mapped here as [proper nouns](PROPN), and 2. name adjectives, which are mapped to [adjectives](ADJ). 

### Examples

- _Мария, Иван_ / _Maria, Ivan_ "Mary, John"
- _София, Холандия_ / _Sofiya, Holandia_ "Sofia, Holland"
- _Иванов, Петрова_ / _Ivanov, Petrova_ as in _господин Иванов, госпожа Петрова_ / _gospodin Ivanov_, gospozha Petrova_ "Mr. Ivanov, Ms. Petrova"
- Клинтън / _"Klintan"_ "Clinton"

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.
