### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. 

In Bultreebank the common nouns are annotated with the tag `Nc#`.


### Examples

- _момиче_ / _momiche_ "girl"
- _котка_ / _kotka_ "cat"
- _дърво_ / _darvo_ "tree"
- _въздух_ / _vazduh_ "air"
- _красота_ / _krasota_ "beauty"

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.
