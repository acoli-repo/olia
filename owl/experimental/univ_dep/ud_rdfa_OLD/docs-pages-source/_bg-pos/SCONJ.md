### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions
by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating
conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the
status of a (subordinate) clause.

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CONJ]().

In the BulTreeBank annotation scheme, our tag `Cs` is mapped to the universal one [SCONJ]().
According to our scheme the multiword subordinate conjunctions are also labeled as `Cs`.
So, such cases are excluded here and analysed compositionally, as recommended in the universal tagset.

### Examples

- _ако_ / _ako_ "if"
- _щом_ / _shtom_ "as soon as"
- _докато_ / _dokato_ "while"
