### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

In Bulgarian the auxiliary verbs are varieties of the verb 'to be':

- Vx# / _съм_ / _sam_ "to be" 
- Vy# /_бъда_ / _bada_ "to be" 
- Vi# / _бивам_ / _bivam_ "to be" 

_Modal verbs_ count as [main verbs](VERB) in BulTreeBank tagset and they are thus tagged `VERB`.


### Examples

- Tense and passive auxiliaries: _<b>бях</b>_ / _byah_ "I was"

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.
