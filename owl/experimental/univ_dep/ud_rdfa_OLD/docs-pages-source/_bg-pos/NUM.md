### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used
as determiners or not (as in _Windows <b>Seven</b>_) and whether they
are expressed as words _(four)_, digits _(4)_ or Roman numerals
_(IV)_. Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers
such as _many_ and _few_) are tagged [DET]().

In Bultreebank tagset the tag which maps to `NUM`, is `Mc#`.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3.14159265359_
- _едно, две, три, седемдесет и седем_ / _edno, dve, tri, sedemdeset i sedem_ "one, two, three, seventy-seven"
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_

Note that the symbol `#', used in the Universal POS section indicates a holder for arbitrary number of features, suppressed in the respective tag as irrelevant in the BulTreeBank tagset, when mapped to the Universal one.
