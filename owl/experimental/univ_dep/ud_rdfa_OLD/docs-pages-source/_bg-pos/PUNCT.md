### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups
used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and
_§_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

The punctuation in the BulTreeBank scheme follows the same principles as in the Universal tagset.
Thus, it includes: period, comma, colon, etc.

### Examples

- _Точка_ / _Tochka_ "Period": _<b>.</b>_
- _Запетая_ / _Zapetaya_ "Comma": _<b>,</b>_
- _Скоби_ / _Skobi_ "Parentheses": _<b>()</b>_
