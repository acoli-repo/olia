### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains
their original category when used in exclamations. For example, _God_
is a [NOUN]() even in exclamatory uses.

In BulTreeBank annotation scheme the interjections are tagged as `I`.
These include the following groups: exclamations and onomatopoeic words.

In cases like _God_, the lemmas are tagged as both: `Noun` and `Interjection`.
Thus, only the Noun usage will be kept in the universal setting.

The feedback particles, such as: _yes_ and _no_ are mapped to INTJ with the labels:

- Ta (affirmative) - _да_ / _da_ "yes"
- Tn (negative) - _не_ / _не_ "no"
