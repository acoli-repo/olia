### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger
constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and
expresses a semantic relationship between them.

In BulTreeBank tagset there are three types of conjunctions:

<b>Cc (single coordinating conjunction)</b>

### Examples

- _но_ / _no_ "but"

<b>Cr (repetitive conjunction). These usually contain at least two parts.</b>

### Examples

- _хем..., хем..._ / _hem..., hem..._ "either.... or...."

<b>Cp (single and repetitive conjunction). These usually are used as singletons, but they also might be used
in a repetitive chain.</b>

### Examples

- _и_ / _i_ "and"
