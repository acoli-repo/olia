# Syntax

The syntactic annotation in the Basque UD treebank follows the general guidelines but adds the language-specific relation:

- _acl:rel_ for relative clauses

As for the advervial clauses, several types are distinguished, for example advcl:DENB (temporal advervial clause), advcl:BALD (conditional clase) etc.

The syntactic annotation has been automatically converted from the original Basque dependency Treebank annotation scheme. The following phenomena are known to deviate from the general guidelines and will be fixed in future versions:

* The _remnant_ analysis of ellipsis has not been implemented.
