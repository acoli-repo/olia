In English, numerical expressions such as cardinal and ordinal numbers have a `NumType` feature. 

### `Card`: cardinal number

Cardinal numbers with the PTB tag `CD`.

#### Examples

* _one, 11, ..._

### `Ord`: ordinal number

Ordinal numbers with the PTB tag `JJ`.

####Examples

* _second, 23rd, ..._

(Note that our automatic feature extractor only marks written-out ordinal numbers up to _tenth_ as ordinal numbers. Ordinals expressed with digits such as _42nd_ can be arbitrarily large.)

### `Mult`: multiplicative numbers

The following adverbs with the PTB tag `RB`:

* _once, twice_
