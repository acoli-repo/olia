In English,  `Reflex` is a feature of [pronouns](en-pos/PRON).  It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

### `Yes`: it is reflexive

The following English pronouns have this feature:

* _myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves_

Note that English reflexive pronouns can also be used as intensive pronouns, e.g. _She <b>herself</b> bought a book_. The above mentioned pronouns only have this feature if they are used as reflexive pronouns.
