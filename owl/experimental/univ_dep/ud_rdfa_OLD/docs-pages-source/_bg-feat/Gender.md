Gender is usually a lexical feature of nouns and inflectional
feature of other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs) that mark
agreement with nouns. In Bulgarian gender is grammatical.

There are three genders: _masculine(m)_, _feminine (f)_ and _neuter (n)_.

### Masc: masculine gender

Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.

Example: [bg]
<I><span style='color: red'>замък</span></I> / _zamak_ "castle"

### Fem: feminine gender

Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also grammatically
feminine, without any relation to sex.

Example: [bg] <I><span style='color: red'>маса</span></I> / _masa_ "table"

### Neut: neuter gender

Neither masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

Example: [bg] <I><span style='color:red'>дете</span></I> / _dete_ "child"
