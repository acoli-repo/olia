Number is an inflectional feature of nouns, adjectives, verbs. In the tagset it is encoded as: singular (s), plural (p), count (c), pluralia tantum (l). Singularia tantum is not encoded.

### Sing: singular number

A singular noun denotes one person, animal or thing.

Examples: [bg] молив / _moliv_ (pencil)

### Plur: plural number

A plural noun denotes several persons, animals or things.

Examples: [bg] моливи / _molivi_ (pencils)

### Count: count plural form

A form that is used as plural for masculine non-person nouns after numerals. This is a remnant of the dual form.

Examples: [bg]  2 молива / _(2) moliva_ (2 pencils-count)

### Ptan: plurale tantum

Some nouns appear only in the plural form even though they denote one thing (semantic singular); some tagsets mark this distinction. 

Examples: [bg] финанси, дънки / _finansi, danki_ (finances, jeans)

### Coll: collective / mass / singulare tantum

Collective or mass or singulare tantum is a special case of singular. It applies to words that use grammatical singular to describe sets of objects, i.e. semantic plural. 

Examples: [bg] човечество / _chovechestvo_ (mankind)
