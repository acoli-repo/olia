Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

In Bulgarian the comparative and superlative forms are created with the help of
the particles `по` / _po_ "more" and `най` / _nay_ "most", which are part of the word and come in preposition,
separated by a defice.

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.


#### Examples

- удобен стол / _udoben stol_ "a comfortable chair"
- млад човек / _mlad chovek_ "a young man"

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

- Моят стол е <b>по-удобен</b> от твоя / _Moyat stol e <b>po-udoben</b> ot tvoya_ "My chair is more comfortable than yours"
- Брат ми е <b>по-млад</b> от мен / _Brat mi e <b>po-mlad</b> ot men_ "My brother is younger than me"

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

- Този стол е <b>най-удобният</b> от всички / _Tozi stol e <b>nay-udobniyat</b> ot vsichki_ "This chair is the most comfortable of all"
- Той е <b>най-младият</b> учител в училището / _Toy e <b>nay-mladiyat</b> uchitel v uchilishteto_ "He is the youngest teacher in the school"
