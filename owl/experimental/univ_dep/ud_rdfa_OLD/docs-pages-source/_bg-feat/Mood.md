Mood

Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.
In Bulgarian there are three moods: _Indicative_, _Imperative_ and _Conditional_.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker. Indicative covers all the 9 tenses
and their passive forms in Bulgarian. It also covers the evidential forms.

#### Examples

- <b>Следвам</b> право в университета. / _Sledvam pravo v universiteta_ "I study law at the University".
- Той <b>беше ходил</b> в САЩ много пъти. / _Toy beshe hodil v SASHT mnogo pati_ "He had been to the USA many times".

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb. The forms in Bulgarian are synthetic.

#### Examples

- <b>Купете</b> хляб и сирене! / _Kupete hlyab i sirene_ "Buy some bread and cheese!"
- <b>Подай</b> ми солта, моля! / _Poday mi solta, molya_ "Pass me the salt, please!"


### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that might happen under certain
circumstances or that would have taken place but they actually did not / do not
happen. It usually presupposes volition. The forms in Bulgarian are analytic.

#### Examples

- <b>Бих дошъл</b>, ако ме поканиш. / _Bih doshal, ako me pokanish_ "I would come if you invite me."
- <b>Бих дошъл</b>, ако имах възможност. / _Bih doshal, ako imah vazmozhnost_ "I would come if I could."
- <b>Би трябвало</b> добре да се подготвим за срещата. / _Bi tryabvalo dobre da se podgotvim za sreshtata_ "We should prepare very well for the meeting."
