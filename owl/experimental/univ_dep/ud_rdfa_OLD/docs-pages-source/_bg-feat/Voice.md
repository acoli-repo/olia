Voice

For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

In Bulgarian linguistics there are various theories of Voice distinctions: 2-voice one (active vs. passive),
3-voice one (active vs. passive vs. reflexive), 4-voice one(active vs. passive vs. reflexive vs. impersonal).

Here the 2-voice theory is adopted.

### `Act`: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (pacient).

#### Examples

- <b>Нападнахме</b> врага. / _Napadnahme vraga_ "We attacked the enemy".
- Децата <b>се засмяха</b>. / _Detsata se zasmyaha_ "The children laughed".
- Децата <b>се измиха</b>. / _Detsata se izmiha_ "The children washed themselves".

### `Pass`: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer
(agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an object of the verb.
In Bulgarian there are two ways of forming passive:

* tenses plus the reflexive particle _se_
* special participial conjugation

#### Examples

- Тази книга <b>се чете лесно</b>. / _Tazi kniga se chete lesno_ "This book reads easily".
- Тази книга <b>беше прочетена</b> по-бързо от другите. / _Tazi kniga beshe prochetena po-barzo ot drugite_ "This book was read faster than the others".
