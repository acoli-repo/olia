In Bulgarian only some nouns have special vocative forms (v):

### Examples

- Иване, приятелю, Родино, Стефке / _Ivane, priyatelyu, Rodino, Stefke_ (Ivan, friend, homeland, Stefka)

The cases are still alive in personal pronouns: _nominative (n)_, _accusative (a)_ and _dative (d)_.

### Examples

- нея, тя, му, го / _neya, tya, mu, go_ (her.ACC.LONG, she.NOM, him.DAT.SHORT, him.ACC.SHORT).

Accusative and dative cases are still present in the masculine, singular forms of some other pronouns – _interrogative, indefinite, collective, relative, negative_. Please note that the dative forms are analytical and thus, only the accusative form is marked after the preposition ‘на’.

### Examples

- кого, някого, никого / _kogo, nyakogo, nikogo_ (whom, someone.ACC, nobody.ACC)
- на кого, на някого, на никого / _na kogo, na nyakogo, na nikogo_ (to whom, to someone.ACC, to nobody.ACC)

In our tagset another idiosyncratic case has been marked – the so-called ‘dative possessive case’ (s). It refers to situations where the short possessive pronoun comes before its possessor noun and thus – next to the verb.

### Examples

- Той ми взе шапката / _Toy mi vze shapkata_ 'He my.POSS took hat.DEF' (He took my hat.) 

The canonical sentence would be: _Той взе шапката ми_ / Toy vze shapkata mi 'He took hat.DEF my.POSS' (He took my hat).
