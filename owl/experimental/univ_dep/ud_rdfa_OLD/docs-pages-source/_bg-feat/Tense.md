Tense

Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took /
takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to
another action in the utterance. 
In Bulgarian aspect and tense are separate, although not completely independent of each other.

In Bulgarian there are 9 tenses: 3 synthetic and 6 analytic.

Since the feature _Tense_ is assigned to a single word, i.e. it relates to 
synthetic forms, in Bulgarian it is applicable to only 3 tenses: _Present_, _Aorist_ and _Imperfect_.

### `Past`: past tense / preterite / aorist

The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current
moment. In Bulgarian, this is aorist. It can be used with both imperfective and perfective verbs.

#### Examples

- Те <b>дойдоха</b> навреме. / _Te <b>doydoha</b> navreme_ "They came on time".
- <b>Взе</b> ли си изпита? / _<b>Vze</b> li si izpita?_ "Did you take the exam?"

### `Pres`: present tense

The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now, that are crossing the moment of speaking or that
usually happen. In Bulgarian present tense has a lot of usages: for actual activities (where the perfective verbs are blocked);
for historical events, for habitual activities, etc.

#### Examples

- В момента <b>чета</b>. / _V momenta cheta_ "I am reading now".
- Всеки ден <b>чета</b>. / _Vseki den cheta_ "I read every day".

### `Imp`: imperfect

Imperfect is a special case of the past tense. It denotes actions that are happening during
some past moment. These actions might continue after the moment of speaking, but also might not, i.e.
the evidence is not in the form itself, but it is in the context.
Both verbs - perfective and imperfective - are used in imperfect tense.

- Когато се прибрах вкъщи, децата вече <b>спяха</b>. / _Kogato se pribrah vkashti, detsata veche spyaha_ "When I came home, the children were already asleep."
- Щом <b>дойдеше</b>, веднага запалваше цигара. / _Shtom doydeshe, vednaga zapalvashe tsigara_ "Every time he came, he always lit a cigarette".
