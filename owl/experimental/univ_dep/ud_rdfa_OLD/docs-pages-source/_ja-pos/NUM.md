### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are convered by [NUM](),
which are tagged with `noun(numeral)` / 名詞-数詞 in UniDic,
including Kanji expressions
(e.g. _<b>二十</b>_&nbsp;“20”, _<b>六万</b>_&nbsp;“60,000”).

Note that each numeral is split into one or more word units 
based on the number of units, (e.g. _<b>二千十四</b>&nbsp;“2014”
is split into three words, 
 _<b>二千</b>_&nbsp;“2000”, _<b>十</b>_&nbsp;“10”　and
_<b>四</b>_&nbsp;“4”).
