### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such
categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify
[adjectives](ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _<b>とても はっきり</b>&nbsp;_
“very clearly” or _<b>おそらく</b> 悪い&nbsp;_ “probably wrong”.

Note that nouns tagged with `noun(common.adverbial)`/名詞-普通名詞-副詞可能
in UniDic, which are able to modify verbs and adjectives, are classified into
 [NOUN]() (e.g. _<b>第一</b>&nbsp;_ “first / firstly”,
_<b>明日</b>&nbsp;_ “tomorrow”).

### Examples

- _<b>とても</b>&nbsp;_ “very”(`adverb` / 副詞)
- _<b>うまく</b>&nbsp;_ “well”(`adverb` / 副詞)
- _<b>まさに</b>&nbsp;_ “exactly”(`adverb` / 副詞)
- totality adverbs: _<b>必ず</b>&nbsp;_ “always”(`adverb` / 副詞)
