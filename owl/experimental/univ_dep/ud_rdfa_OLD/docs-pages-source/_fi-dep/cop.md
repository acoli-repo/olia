Copular clauses receive a special treatment in the SD scheme. The
predicative acts as the head word of the clause, and the copular verb
depends on it using a `cop` (*copula*) dependency. The only copular
verb in Finnish is *olla* "be" (see ISK
[ยง891](http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=891)).

<!-- TODO Distinguishing copular structures from other constructs as
well as recognizing the subject and the predicative is discussed in
Section [copulas](#sec-copulas). -->
