The dependency type `dep` is used when no other, more specific dependency
type applies, for example due to software limitation or error.

In the original TDT corpus, the type `dep` is additionally used to
annotate a number of idiomatic multi-word-expressions. In UD Finnish,
these are annotated as [mwe]().
