title:  'conj'
shortdef : 'coordinated element'
---

The SD scheme marks coordination so that the first coordinated element acts as the head, and the rest of the elements in the coordination, as well as the coordinating conjunction, depend on it. *Coordinated elements* are marked with the dependency type `conj`.

`Conj` is in Finnish used also in implicit coordinations without a coordinating conjunction, when the coordinated elements are not separated by a colon, semicolon or dash. When one of these is present, `parataxis` is used.
