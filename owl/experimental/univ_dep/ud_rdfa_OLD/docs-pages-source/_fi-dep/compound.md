`compound` is one of the three UD relations UD for compounding,
together with [mwe]() and [name]().

UD Finnish additionally defines two subtypes of `compound`,
[compound:nn]() for noun compounds and [compound:prt]()
for phrasal verb particles. As the other UD types and the
UD Finnish subtypes cover most cases of compounding, only
few cases are annotated specifically as `compound`.

Numerical expressions consisting of multiple tokens are annotated
using the `compound` dependency type. The last word of the numerical
expression is the governor, and the number dependencies are chained.

(These relations are annotated `number` in
[TDT](http://bionlp.utu.fi/fintreebank.html).)
