Possessives may have two different numbers: that of the possessed object (number
agreement with modified noun) and that of the possessor. The
`Number[psor]` feature captures the possessor's number.

### `Sing`: singular possessor

#### Examples

* _<b>můj</b> pes_ “my dog” `Number[psor]=Sing|Number=Sing`
* _<b>mí</b> psi_ “my dogs” `Number[psor]=Sing|Number=Plur`

### `Plur`: plural possessor

#### Examples

* _<b>náš</b> pes_ “our dog” `Number[psor]=Plur|Number=Sing`
* _<b>naši</b> psi_ “our dogs” `Number[psor]=Plur|Number=Plur`
