Gender is a lexical feature of [nouns](cs-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([adjectives](cs-pos/ADJ), [verbs](cs-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. There are three values of gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

### `Masc`: masculine gender

Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* _<b>pán</b>&nbsp;_ “gentleman”
* _<b>hrad</b>&nbsp;_ “castle”
* _<b>muž</b>&nbsp;_ “man”
* _<b>stroj</b>&nbsp;_ “machine”
* _<b>předseda</b>&nbsp;_ “chairman”
* _<b>soudce</b>&nbsp;_ “judge”

### `Fem`: feminine gender

Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically feminine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* _<b>žena</b>&nbsp;_ “woman”
* _<b>růže</b>&nbsp;_ “rose”
* _<b>píseň</b>&nbsp;_ “song”
* _<b>kost</b>&nbsp;_ “bone”

### `Neut`: neuter gender

This third gender is for nouns that are neither
masculine nor feminine (grammatically).
Nouns whose nominative suffix is _-o&nbsp;_ or _-í&nbsp;_
(including a large group of deverbative nouns denoting actions)
are usually neuter.

#### Examples

* _<b>město</b>&nbsp;_ “city”
* _<b>moře</b>&nbsp;_ “sea”
* _<b>kuře</b>&nbsp;_ “chicken”
* _<b>stavení</b>&nbsp;_ “building”
