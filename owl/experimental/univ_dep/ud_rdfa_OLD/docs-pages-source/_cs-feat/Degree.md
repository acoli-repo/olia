Degree of comparison is inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](cs-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](cs-pos/ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* _<b>mladý</b> muž&nbsp;_ “<b>young</b> man”

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _ten muž je <b>mladší</b> než já&nbsp;_ “the man is <b>younger</b> than me”

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _toto je <b>nejmladší</b> muž v našem týmu&nbsp;_ “this is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team”
