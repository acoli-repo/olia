Person is a feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](cs-pos/PRON), and of [verbs](cs-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (Czech is a pro-drop language).

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

#### Examples

* _<b>dělám</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>I</b> do”
* _<b>děláme</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>we</b> do”

### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>děláš</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>.`Sing` do”
* _<b>děláte</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>.`Plur` do”

### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _<b>dělá</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>he/she/it does</b>”
* _<b>dělají</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>they</b> do”
