### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

The `X` tag is disprefered, but kept in the treebank from the conversion of the previous tags in the initial distribution of the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank for foreign words, OCR errors, and parts of distributionally arranged compounds like _<b>musik-</b> og billedprogrammer_ "<b>music</b> and image programs"
