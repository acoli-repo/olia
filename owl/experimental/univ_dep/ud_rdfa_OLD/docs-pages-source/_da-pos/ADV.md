### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [adjectives](ADJ),
[verbs](VERB) or other adverbs for such categories as time, place,
direction or manner.

Note that in Danish, some adverbs may also function as
verbal particles, as in _se <b>ud</b>_ "look".  They
are still tagged `ADV` and not [PART]().

### Examples

- _<b>meget</b> vigtigt_ "<b>very</b> important"
- _v√¶k_ "away"
- _ikke_ "not" as in _jeg spiser <b>ikke</b> rejer_ "I do not eat prawns"
- _pludselig_ "suddenly"
