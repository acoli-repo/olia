### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Danish auxiliary verbs can be divided into tense auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries, passive auxiliaries, and copulas.

### Examples

- Tense auxiliary: _<b>har</b> købt_ "<b>has</b> bought"
- Modal auxiliary: _<b>kunne</b> tænke_ "can think"
- Passive auxiliary: _<b>blev</b>_ fundet "was found"
- Copula: _<b>var</b> grøn_ "was green", _<b>er</b> en løsning_ "is a solution"

### Delimitation

Auxiliaries are a closed-class list. The following list breaks down the lemmas of the words marked as AUX into the four kinds of auxiliary verb (which are later disambiguated by their dependency label).

- Tense auxiliary: _have_
- Modal auxiliary: _burde_, _kunne_, _måtte_, _turde_,_skulle_, _ville_
- Passive auxiliary: _blive_
- Copula: _væra_
