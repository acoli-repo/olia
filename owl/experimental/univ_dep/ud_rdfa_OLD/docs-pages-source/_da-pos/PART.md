### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs).

In Danish `PART` is currently used for the infinitive marker _at_. Note that not all instances of _at_ are of type `PART`, as _at_ can also be used as a [SCONJ]().


### Example

- _det er muligt <b>at</b> Ã¦ndre det_ "it is possible <b>to</b> change it"
