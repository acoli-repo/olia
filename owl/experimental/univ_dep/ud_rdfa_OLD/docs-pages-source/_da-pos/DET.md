### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and
express the reference of the noun phrase in context. Like [adjectives](ADJ),
Danish determiners typically agree with the noun they modify for gender and number,
e.g. _<b>din</b> dreng_ "your boy" (common singular), _<b>dit</b> barn_ "your child" (neuter singular), 
_<b>dine</b> d√∏tre_ "your daughters" (plural). 

### Examples

- Articles: _en_ "a/an", _et_ "a/an", _den_ "the", _det_ "the", _de_ "the"  
- Possessive determiners: _min_ "my" as in _<b>min</b> bil_ "my car", _deres_ "their" as in _<b>deres</b> holdninger_ "their opinions", _<b>dit</b> job_ "your job"
- Negative determiners: _ingen_ "no" as in _han har <b>ingen</b> empati_ "he has no empathy"
