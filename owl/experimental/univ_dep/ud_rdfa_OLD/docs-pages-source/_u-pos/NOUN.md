### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Note that some verb forms such as _gerunds_ and _infinitives_ may
share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language
and context, they may be classified as either [VERB]() or `NOUN`.
