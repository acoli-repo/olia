### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by
form, function, or both.

Many symbols are or contain special non-alphanumeric characters,
similarly to [punctuation](PUNCT).  What makes them different from
punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words.  This
involves all currency symbols, e.g. _$ 75_ is identical to
_seventy-five dollars_.

Mathematical operators form another group of symbols.

Another group of symbols is emoticons and emoji.

Strings that consists entirely of alphanumeric characters are not
symbols but they may be [proper nouns](PROPN): _130XE_, _DC10_; others
may be tagged `PROPN` (rather than `SYM`) even if they contain special
characters: _DC-10_. Similarly, abbreviations for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech of the full form. For example, _Mr._ (mister), _kg_ (kilogram), _km_ (kilometer), _Dr_ (Doctor) should be tagged [nouns](NOUN). Acronyms for proper names such as _UN_ and _NATO_ should be tagged as [proper nouns](PROPN).

Characters used as bullets in itemized lists _(‚Ä¢, ‚Ä£)_ are not symbols,
they are punctuation.
