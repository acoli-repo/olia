### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their
properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_The car is green._

The `ADJ` tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only. See [DET]()
for determiners and [NUM]() for numerals.

Note that there are words that may be traditionally called numerals in
some languages (e.g. Czech) but they are treated as adjectives in our
universal tagging scheme. In particular, _ordinal numerals_ (more
precisely _adjectival_ ordinal numerals, because Czech has also
adverbial ones) behave both morphologically and syntactically as
adjectives and are tagged `ADJ`.

Note that _participles_ are word forms that may share properties and
usage of adjectives and verbs. Depending on language and context, they
may be classified as either [VERB]() or `ADJ`.

### Examples

- _big_
- _old_
