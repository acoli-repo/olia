### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a
verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the
lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

_Modal verbs_ may count as auxiliaries in some languages (English). In
other languages their behavior is not too different from the [main
verbs](VERB) and they are thus tagged `VERB`. _Copulas_ also stay with
main verbs.

Note that not all languages have grammaticalized auxiliary verbs, and
even where they exist the dividing line between full verbs and
auxiliary verbs can be expected to vary between languages. Exactly
which verbs are counted as `AUX` should be part of the
language-specific documentation.

### Examples

- Tense auxiliaries: _<b>has</b> (done), <b>is</b> (doing), <b>will</b> (do)_
- Passive auxiliaries: _<b>was</b> (done), <b>got</b> (done)_
- Modal auxiliaries: _<b>should</b> (do), <b>must</b> (do)_
