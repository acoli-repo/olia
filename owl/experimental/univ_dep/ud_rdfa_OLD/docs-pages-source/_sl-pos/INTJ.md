### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language. Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retain their original category when used in exclamations. For example, _odlično_ "great" is an [adverb](ADV) even in exclamatory uses.

As a special case of interjections, the universal tagging scheme also recognizes feedback particles, such as _ja_ "yes" and _ne_ "no". Given that most of the feedback signals in Slovenian can also be used as syntactically more or less dependent modal particles (_to pa <b>ja</b> veš_, _ona <b>itak</b> nima pojma_, _tega <b>ne</b> maram_, _on je <b>seveda</b> poniknil_ etc.), they have not been converted to `INTJ` and remain annotated as [particles](PART) in the current version of the Slovenian UD Treebank.

### Examples

- _ah_, _oh_, _ha_
- _zbogom_, _živijo_, _adijo_ 
- _jebemti_, _bravo_, _ups_

#### Conversion from JOS.

All interjections become `INTJ`.
