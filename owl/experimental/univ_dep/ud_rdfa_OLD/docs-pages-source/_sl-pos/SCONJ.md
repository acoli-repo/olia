### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically introduces a subordinate clause, e.g. _Izvedel sem, <b>da</b> me žena vara._ "I found out that my wife is cheating on me." 

### Examples
* _da_ "that"
* _ki_ "which"
* _kot_ "like"
* _ko_ "when"
* _če_ "if"
* _ker_ "because"
* _kjer_ "where"
* _ko_ "when"
* _čeprav_ "even_though"
* _kakor_ "as"
