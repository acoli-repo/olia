### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both. Symbols are distinct from [punctuation](PUNCT) that delimit linguistic units in printed text and do not have any semantic function.

As opposed to universal guidelines, tokens containing alphanumeric characters, such as URL addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers, are not considered symbols in Slovenian. 


### Examples

- _$, %, °, µ_
- _#, @, ©, &_ 
- _+, ×, =, <, >_

#### Conversion from JOS

The list of characters in ssj500k treebank has been manually divided into subgroups of `PUNCT` and `SYM`. Note that some characters display characteristics of both POS categories, such as asterisk or dash-like characters that can either function as mathematical operators (`SYM`) or bullets in itemized lists (`PUNCT`). In case of such ambiguity, the more common function was chosen.
