### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

In Slovenian, the `VERB` tag covers all verbs (including content, modal and copula verbs), except for the auxiliary verb _biti_ "to be", which is tagged as [AUX]().

Word forms that etymologically derive from verbs, but have different syntactic properties, such as adjectival participles (_ukraden_ "stolen", _pokrit_ "covered"), transgressives (_upoštevaje_ "taking into account", _začenši_ "starting") and gerunds (_govorjenje_ "speaking", _zavrnitev_ "rejection", _gretje_ "heating"), are marked as [adjectives](ADJ), [adverbs](ADV) or [nouns](NOUN) respectively. 

### Examples

* _imeti_ "to have", _vedeti_ "to know", _dobiti_ "to get"
* _morati_ "to must", _moči_ "to be able to", _postati_ "to become"
* _začeti_ "to start,  _iti_ "to go", _priti_ "to come"

#### Conversion from JOS

All verbs with Type=main have been converted to `VERB`. Additionally, those instances of verb _biti_ with Type=auxiliary that do not bear the PPart dependency relation to a main verb have also been converted to `VERB`.
