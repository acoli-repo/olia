# Tokenization

In Japanese there is no obvious word boundary. So we need a definition of words.
As the word definition for universal dependency (UD), we adopt short-unit word
(SUW) [1]. SUW is also adopted to tokenize sentences in Balanced corpus of
contemporary written Japanese (BCCWJ) [2] containing more than 60,000 sentences
in various domains and it has been shown that the SUW definition covers various
language phenomena in real texts.

Many SUWs correspond to a single English word but they tend to be shorter than
English counterparts. An example is "フランス 語" (French; French language).
For detailed definition please refer to [3] written in Japanese.

The automatic tokenization accuracy is more than 98% on in-domain data (BCCWJ)
[4].
