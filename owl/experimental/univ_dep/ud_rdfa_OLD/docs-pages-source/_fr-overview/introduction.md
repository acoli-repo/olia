# Introduction

The French data come from the universal Google dataset (version 2.0): a mix of random sentences sampled from Google News, from Blogger, and from Google local reviews. The conversion to the UD POS and UD dependencies have been performed automatically, using heuristic rules and fixed lists of words (produced by native speakers of the language). The output of the conversion has not been manually corrected.

More information about the original Google dataset can be found in the following paper:
