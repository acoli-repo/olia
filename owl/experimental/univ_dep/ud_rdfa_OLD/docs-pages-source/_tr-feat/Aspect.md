Besides `Prog` and `Perf`, Turkish verbs may express an aspect where the action happens repeatedly, or habitually. Göksel and Kerslake (2005) refer to this as 'habitual' aspect. We mark this aspect with label `Habit` (**new proposal, not in current UD**).

### `Perf`: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have be completed.

#### Examples

* *eve gitti* 'she went home'
* *eve gidecek* 'she will go home'

### `Prog`: progressive aspect

Action is in progress with respect to current or a reference time. Turkish has two progressive markers, *-(I)yor* and *-mAktA*. Latter is used in more formal cases than former. Otherwise distinction between these two suffixes is difficult to make.

#### Examples

* *eve gidiyor* 'she is going home (now)'
* *eve gitmekte* 'she is going home (now)'
* *eve gidiyordu* 'she was going home (when I saw her)'
* *eve gimekteydi* 'she was going home (when I saw her)'

### `Habit`: habitual aspect (**newly propsed**)

Verbal morphology in Turkish may indicate an action that happens repeatedly at present or past. This aspect is mainly marked with suffix *-A/Ir*.

#### Examples

* *çok kitap okur* 'she reads lots of books'
* *sigara içerdi* 'she used to smoke'

### `Rapid`: rapid sudden action (**newly proposed**)

A particular verb form formed by suffix *-Iver* refers to actions that are sudden or performed rapidly. Kornfilt (1995, p.361) calls this rapid or sudden aspect.

#### Examples

* *eve gidiver* 'quickly go home!'
* *eve gidiverdi* 'she immediately/suddenly went home!'


### `Dur`: durative aspect (**newly proposed**)

A situation or action that has persisted over a period of time and still continues is called durative action (Kornfilt 1995, p.362). The suffixes *-Akal*, *-Agel* and *-Adur* indicate this mood (the first one might better be defined as 'durative stative' and others 'durative progressive'). 

#### Examples

* *bakakaldı* 'she looked (for a while, she was frozen while looking)'
* *yapagelmiştir* 'she have gone on doing (something)'
* *okuyadur* 'go on reading'

### `Pro`: prospective aspect

The action is/was about to happen. In Turkish a rather rare suffix *-Ayaz* indicates an event that was about to happen. This is now used only a few fixed expressions, and it only combines with the past tense forms.

#### Examples

* *düşeyazdı* 'she was about to fall'
