# Syntax

The syntactic annotation of the Slovenian UD Treebank has been obtained by automatic conversion from [JOS dependency annotation scheme](http://eng.slovenscina.eu/tehnologije/razclenjevalnik), based on a large set of rules including different lexical, morphological and syntactic features. The current version of the Slovenian UD Treebank includes 31 universal relations and one language-specific extension ([cc:preconj](../../en/feat/cc-preconj.html)). The universal dependency relations that are not currently being used are labels relating to voice ([nsubjpass](../../u/dep/nsubjpass.html), [csubjpass](../../u/dep/csubjpass.html), [auxpass](../../u/dep/auxpass.html)) and some other loose joining relations that had not been annotated within the original JOS annotation scheme ([list](../../u/dep/list.html), [dislocated](../../u/dep/dislocated.html), [remnant](../../u/dep/remnant.html), [reparandum](../../u/dep/reparandum.html), [vocative](../../u/dep/vocative.html) and [goeswith](../../u/dep/goeswith.html)).

The original JOS annotations have been preserved as part of the [MISC column](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html) in the released data. Further revisions of this work, addition of new conversion rules and online guidelines for syntactic annotation remain work in progress.
