Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and
articles. Its value distinguishes whether we are talking about
something known and concrete, or something general or unknown. It can
be marked on definite and indefinite [articles](u-pos/DET), or
directly on [nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) etc.  In
Arabic, definiteness is also called the "state".

### `Ind`: indefinite

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>a</b> dog_

### `Def`: definite

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>the</b> dog_

### `Red`: reduced

Used in [construct
state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus) in Arabic. If
two nouns are in genitive relation, the first one (the "nomen regens")
has "reduced definiteness," the second is the genitive and can be
either definite or indefinite.  Reduced form has neither the definite
morpheme (article), nor the indefinite morpheme (nunation).

#### Examples

* [ar] indefinite state: حلوَةٌ_ḥulwatun_ "a sweet"; definite state:
  الحلوَةُ _al-ḥulwatu_ "the sweet"; <b>حلوَةُ </b>_<b>ḥulwatu</b>_
  "sweet of".

### `Com`: complex

annexation</A> in Arabic. The genitive construction described above
normally consists of two nouns (first reduced, second genitive). That
is called proper annexation or iḍāfa. If the first member is an
adjective or adjectivally used participle and the second member is a
definite noun, the construction is called improper annexation or false
iḍāfa.  The result is a compound adjective that is usually used as an
attributive adjunct and thus must agree in definiteness with the noun
it modifies. Its first part (the adjective or participle) may get
again the definite article. Although it may look the same as the form
for the definite state, it is assigned a special value of _complex_
state to reflect the different origin. See also <A
