Negativeness is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), sometimes also [adverbs](u-pos/ADV) and
[nouns](u-pos/NOUN) in languages that negate using bound
morphemes. For instance, all Czech verbs and adjectives can be negated
using the prefix _ne-_.  In English, verbs are negated using the
[particle](u-pos/PART) _not_ and adjectives are also negated using
prefixes, although the process is less productive than in Czech _(wise
&ndash; unwise, probable &ndash; improbable)_.

Note that `Negative=Neg` is not the same thing as
[PronType]()`=Neg`. For pronouns and other pronominal parts of speech
there is no such binary opposition as for verbs and adjectives. (There
is no such thing as "affirmative pronoun".)

The negativeness feature could be also used to distinguish response
[interjections](u-pos/INTJ) _yes_ and _no_.

### `Pos`: positive, affirmative

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>přišel</b>_ "he came"

### Neg: negative

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>nepřišel</b>_ "he did not come"
