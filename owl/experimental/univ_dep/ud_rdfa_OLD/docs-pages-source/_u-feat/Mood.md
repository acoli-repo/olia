Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě._ "<b>You study</b> at the
  university."
* [de] _<b>Du studierst</b> an der Universität._ "<b>You study</b> at
  the university."

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"
* [de] _<b>Studiere</b> an der Universität!_ "<b>Study</b> at the university!"

### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. Grammars of some languages may classify conditional as tense
(rather than mood) but e.g. in Czech it combines with two different
tenses (past and present).

#### Examples

* [cs] _Kdy <b>bych</b> byl chytrý, studoval <b>bych</b> na
  univerzitě._ "If I were smart I <b>would</b> study at the
  university" (note that only the auxiliary _bych_ is specific to
  conditional; the active participle _byl_ is also needed to
  analytically form the conditional mood, however, it will only be
  tagged as participle because it can also be used to form past tense
  indicative.)

### `Pot`: potential

The action of the verb is likely but not certain. Used e.g. in
Finnish.

### `Sub`: subjunctive / conjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used under certain circumstances in
subordinate clauses, typically for actions that are subjective or
otherwise uncertain. In German, it may be also used to convey the
conditional meaning.

#### Examples

* [fr] _Je veux que tu le <b>fasses</b> "I want you to do it" lit. _I
  want that you it do.Sub_

### `Jus`: jussive

The jussive mood expresses the desire that the action happens. Used
e.g. in Arabic.

### `Qot`: quotative

The quotative mood is used e.g. in Estonian to denote direct speech.

### `Opt`: optative

Used e.g. in Turkish in exclamations like "May you have a long life!"
or "If only I were rich!"

### `Des`: desiderative

The desiderative mood corresponds to the modal verb "want to": "He
<b>wants to come</b>." Used e.g. in Turkish.

### `Nec`: necessitative

The necessitative mood corresponds to the modal verbs "must, should,
have to": "He <b>must</b><b> come</b>." Used e.g. in Turkish.
