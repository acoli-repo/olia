Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](u-pos/PRON) / [determiners](u-pos/DET), and of [verbs](u-pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject
(some languages, e.g. Basque, can also mark person of objects). Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (pro-drop
languages).

### `1`: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. Some languages (e.g. Taiwanese) distinguish inclusive and
exclusive 1<SUP>st</SUP> person plural pronouns: the former include
the addressee of the utterance (i.e. _I + you_), the latter exclude
them (i.e. _I + they_).

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>I</b>_, _<b>we</b>_
* [cs] _<b>dělám</b>_ "<b>I</b> do"

### `2`: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>you</b>_
* [cs] _<b>děláš</b>_ "<b>you</b> do"

### `3`: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>he</b>_, _<b>she</b>_, _<b>it</b>_, _<b>they</b>_
* [cs] _<b>dělá</b>_ "<b>he/she/it does</b>"
