#### Description

Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

In Irish, third person pronouns have two forms, roughly corresponding to nominative (e.g. _sé_) and accusative (e.g. _é_) cases.
Irish pronouns also have emphatic forms. 
Pronouns are often incorporated through inflection in synthetic verb forms and prepositions.

Augment pronouns appear in copula constructions when the subject is 3rd person singular or plural. The pronoun precedes the subject.

Both the indirect and direct relative pronoun are represented by _a_.

Irish demonstratives are either post-determiners (see [DET]()), when modifying a noun, or simply demonstrative pronouns (_siúd, seo, sin_)
