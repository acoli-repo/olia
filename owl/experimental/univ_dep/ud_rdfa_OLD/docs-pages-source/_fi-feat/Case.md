### `Nom`: nominative

The base form, typically used as a citation form (lemma).

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>koira</b> juoksee_ "the <b>dog</b> runs"

### `Acc`: accusative

In many languages used for direct objects of verbs.

We follow ISK in not recognizing the accusative except for the personal pronouns
and _kuka_ "who" (<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=1221>,
<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=1226>)

#### Examples

* [fi] _näen hänet_ "I see him/her"
* [fi] _kenet näet?_ "who do you see?"

### `Gen`: genitive

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>meidän</b> perheemme_ "<b>our</b> family"
* [fi] _<b>vuoden</b> päivät_ "the days of the <b>year</b>"
* [fi] _<b>Turun</b> Yliopisto_ "University of <b>Turku</b>"

### `Ins`: instructive

Instructive primarily characterizes manner or instrument. Instructive can
also express place or time.

Corresponds to some uses of English *by means of* or *with the aid of*.

#### Examples

* [fi] _kaksin <b>käsin</b>_ "with both <b>hands</b>"
* [fi] _uusin <b>säännöin</b>_ "with new <b>rules</b>"
* [fi] _näillä <b>seuduin</b>_ "around these <b>parts</b>"
* [fi] _vuoroviikoin_ "every other week"

### `Par`: partitive

In Finnish the partitive case is an object case that can also express
indefinite quantity or unfinished actions.

* [fi] _kolme <b>taloa</b>_ "three <b>houses</b>"
* [fi] _rakastan tätä <b>taloa</b>_ "I love this <b>house</b>"
* [fi] _saanko lainata <b>kirjaa</b>_ "can I borrow a <b>book</b>"
* [fi] _lasissa on <b>maitoa</b>_ "there is (some) <b>milk</b> in the glass"
* [fi] _ammuin karhua_ "I shot at a bear"
* [fi] _luen kirjaa_ "I am reading a book"

### `Ess`: essive

Essive is typically a case of temporal adverbials (e.g. 
_tiistaina_ "on Tuesday"). In expressions of state, essive
is a case of predicative adverbials, characterizing purpose
or task (e.g. _vartijana_ "as a guard") in intransitive
forms, and how an object or its purpose is perceived in
transitive forms (e.g. _syödä <b>raakana</b>_ "eat <b>raw</b>").

Essive corresponds to some uses of English _as a_.

#### Examples

* [fi] _tiistaina_ "on Tuesday"
* [fi] _vartijana_ "as a guard"

### `Tra`: translative

In intransitive sentences, the translative case typically expresses
change of state (_becomes_, _changes to_) or manner.

#### Examples

* [fi] _pitkäksi_ "become long"
* [fi] _englanniksi_ "in/into English"
* [fi] _kello <b>kuudeksi</b>_ "by <b>six</b> o'clock"
* [fi] _huviksi_ "for fun"

In transitive sentences, the translative case describes the sentence object.

#### Examples

* [fi] _tarkoitettu <b>varoitukseksi</b>_ "meant <b>as a warning</b>"
* [fi] _valittiin <b>presidentiksi</b>_ "elected <b>as president</b>"

### `Com`: comitative / associative

The comitative (also called associative) case expresses belonging, a social relationship or a part of an entity. It often corresponds to English _together with_ and has a descriptive or explicative function. 

#### Examples

* [fi] _tavaroineen_ "with his/her belongings"
* [fi] _puolisoineen_ "with his/her spouse"
* [fi] _koirat suurine hampaineen_ "dogs with their big teeth"

### `Abe`: abessive

The abessive case expresses wihtout what something has happened and roughly corresponds to the English preposition _without_.

#### Examples

* [fi] _rahatta_ "without money"



### `Ine`: inessive

The inessive case expresses location inside of something.

#### Examples

* [fi] _talossa_ "in the house"

### `Ill`: illative

The illative case expresses direction into something.

#### Examples

* [fi] _taloon_ "to the house"

### `Ela`: elative

The elative case expresses direction out of something.

#### Examples

* [fi] _talosta_ "from the house"

### `Ade`: adessive

The adessive cases expresses location on the outer or upper
surface of an entity, or movement to/from such a surface. The 
corresponding directional cases are allative (towards something)
and ablative (from something).

(**Note**: this is a very incomplete listing of the uses of the
Finnish adessive, which can also express place, time, state,
owner, instrument, means, manner, and quantity.)

#### Examples

* [fi] _pöydällä_ "on the table"

#### References

* <http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=1252> (in Finnish)

### `All`: allative

The allative case expresses direction onto something (destination
is adessive).

#### Examples

* [fi] _pöydälle_ "on to the table"

### `Abl`: ablative

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.

#### Examples

* [fi] _pöydältä_ "from the table"
* [fi] _katolta_ "from the roof"
* [fi] _rannalta_ "from the beach"

### Notes: distributive

Some descriptions of Finnish recognize a distributive case conveying
that something happens to every member of a set, one at a time. UD
Finnish does not include `Dis` (distributive) as a possible value of
the `Case` feature, but analyses the _-ttain_ suffix as an adverbial
derivation.

#### Examples

* [fi] _kaupungeittain_ "separately in each city"

#### References

* <http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=379> (in Finnish)

### Notes: lative

Some descriptions of Finnish mark the base form of the first
infinitive as being in the lative case (see e.g.
[Omorfi tagger documentation](https://code.google.com/p/omorfi/wiki/AnalysisPossibilities#Infinite_forms_of_verbs)).
UD Finnish follows ISK in not recognizing the lative case.
