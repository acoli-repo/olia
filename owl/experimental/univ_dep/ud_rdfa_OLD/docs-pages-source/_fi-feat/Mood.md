Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](fi-pos/VERB) forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [fi] _minä <b>sanon</b>_ "I <b>say</b>"

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>kypsennä</b> uunissa_ "_<b>fry</b> in the oven_"

### Cnd: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>tarvistisimme</b> tilaa_ "we <b>would need</b> space"

### Pot: potential

The action of the verb is likely but not certain.

#### Examples

* [fi] _talo <b>valmistunee</b>_ "the house <b>will likely be completed</b>"
