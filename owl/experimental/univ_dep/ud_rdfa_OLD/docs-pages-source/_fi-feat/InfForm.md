Finnish has multiple infinitive forms, often termed the first
infinitive, second infinitive, etc. Traditionally five different
infinitives have been recognized, but UD Finnish follows the modern
[ISK grammar](http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/etusivu.php) in only
recognizing three verb forms as infinitives, namely those known as the
first, second and third infinitives (alternatively termed the A-, E-
and MA-infinitives, see e.g. [VISK ยง
119](http://kaino.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=119); in Finnish).

### `1`: first infinitive

The first infinitive is also known as the A-infinitive. It corresponds
roughly to the English infinitive introduced by *to*.

The base form of the first infinitive is used as the dictionary form
for verbs.

#### Examples

* [fi] _He haluavat <b>jutella</b>_ "They want to <b>talk</b>"
