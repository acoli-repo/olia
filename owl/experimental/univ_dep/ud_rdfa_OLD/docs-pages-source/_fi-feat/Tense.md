The `Tense` feature applies to verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()),
specifying the time when the action took or takes place, in
relation to the current moment or to another action in the
utterance.

`Tense` does not apply to non-finite verbs (infinitives and
participles), the negation verb *ei*, or verbs not in the
indicative mood (see
<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk/sisallys.php?p=111>; in Finnish).

### `Pres`: present tense

The present tense denotes actions that are happening right now or that
usually happen.

#### Examples

* [fi] _järjestelmä <b>toimii</b>_ "the system <b>works</b>"

### `Past`: past tense / preterite

The past tense denotes actions that happened before the current
moment.

#### Examples

* [fi] _joukkue <b>voitti</b>_ "the team <b>won</b>"
