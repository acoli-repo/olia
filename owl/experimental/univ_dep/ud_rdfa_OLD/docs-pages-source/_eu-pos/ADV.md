#### Description
Adverbs are words that typically modify adjectives, verbs or other adverbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. In Basque, the free word order allows the averbs to appear on either side of the verb.

#### Examples

* Following the verb: <b>_azkar_</b> _doa_  "fast goes"   
* Preceding the verb:  _darama_ <b>sarritan</b>  "carries frequently"
* <b>oso</b> _azkar_  "very fast"
