Reflexiveness is a lexical feature of some [pronouns](PRON) and [determiners](DET). It tells whether the word is reflexive,
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

We distinguish three types of reflexive word forms in Slovenian: reflexive pronoun _<b>se</b>_ "oneself", bound reflexive pronouns (e.g. _<b>zase</b>_ "for oneself") and possessive pronoun/determiner _<b>svoj</b>_ "one's own".

Note that reflexive pronoun _se_ can also be used in subjectless passive constructions and as a free morpheme of pseudo-reflexive verbs.
