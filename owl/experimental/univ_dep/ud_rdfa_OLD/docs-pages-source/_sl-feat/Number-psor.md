Possessive [pronouns](PRON) and [determiners](DET) may have two different numbers: that of the possessed object (in agreement with the modifying noun, inflectional feature) and that of the possessor (inherent, lexical feature). The `Number[psor]` feature denotes the possessor's number.

### `Sing`: singular possessor

#### Examples

* _<b>moj</b> balon_ “my balloon” `Number[psor]=Sing|Number=Sing`
* _<b>moja</b> balona_ “my (two) balloons” `Number[psor]=Sing|Number=Dual`
* _<b>moji</b> baloni_ “my (three or more) balloons” `Number[psor]=Sing|Number=Plur`

### `Dual`: dual possessor

#### Examples

* _<b>najin</b> balon_ “my and your balloon” `Number[psor]=Dual|Number=Sing`
* _<b>najina</b> balona_ “my and your (two) balloons” `Number[psor]=Dual|Number=Dual`
* _<b>najini</b> baloni_ “my and your (three or more) balloons” `Number[psor]=Dual|Number=Plur`

### `Plur`: plura possessor

#### Examples

* _<b>naš</b> balon_ “our balloon” `Number[psor]=Plur|Number=Sing`
* _<b>naša</b> balona_ “our (two) balloons” `Number[psor]=Plur|Number=Dual`
* _<b>naši</b> baloni_ “our (three or more) balloons” `Number[psor]=Plur|Number=Plur`
