`Possessive` is a lexical feature of [adjectives](ADJ), [determiners](DET) and [pronouns](PRON).  It tells whether the word is possessive. Words without the `Poss` feature are not possessive.

### `Yes`: it is possessive

#### Examples

* _mamin_ "mother's", _vanilijev_ "vanilla's"
* _moj_, "my/mine", _naš_ "our/ours"
* _svoj_ "one's own"

### Conversion from JOS

All adjectives and pronouns with Type=possessive are converted to `Poss=Yes`. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun _svoj_ is also converted to `Poss=Yes`. Note that within JOS annotation scheme, possessiveness is not explicitly marked with other types of pronouns that denote possession, such as _ćigav, čigaver, nikogaršnji_ etc.
