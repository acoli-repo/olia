Degree of comparison is an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](ADJ) and [adverbs](ADV).

### `Pos`: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something, without comparing it to qualities of others.

#### Examples

* _<b>star</b> človek_ "an old man"
* _<b>hitro</b>_ narejeno "quickly done"

### `Cmp`: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object. For most adverbs, two different word forms can be used interchangeably.

#### Examples

* _<b>starejši</b> človek_ "an older man"
* _<b>hitreje / hitrejše </b>_ narejeno "done more quickly"

### `Sup`: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set. For most adverbs, two different word forms can be used interchangeably.

#### Examples

* _<b>najstarejši</b> človek_ "the oldest man"
* _<b>najhitreje / najhitrejše </b>_ narejeno "done most quickly"
