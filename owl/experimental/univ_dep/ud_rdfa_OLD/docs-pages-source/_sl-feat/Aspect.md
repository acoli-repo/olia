Aspect is a lexical feature of [verbs](VERB) that specifies the duration and completion of action in time.

Slovenian grammar distinguishes two aspect values: `imperfect` and `perfect`. Pairs of imperfective and perfective verbs exist and are often morphologically related, but the verbs are considered to belong to separate lemmas.

### `Imp`: imperfect aspect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no information whether and when it was / will be completed.

* _Danes se ni <b>zgodilo</b> nič posebnega._ "Nothing special has happened today."

### `Perf`: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion).

* _Pogosto se je <b>dogajalo</b>, da je zamujal._ "It often happened he was late."


### Verbs without `Aspect`

Verbs without `Aspect` are considered to be biaspectual, i.e. they can either denote duration or completion, but their actual interpretation depends on the context.

* _Takoj sem <b>telefoniral</b> na policijo._ "I called the police immediately"
* _Cel dan sem <b>telefoniral</b>, a se nihče ni javil._ "I have been calling all day, but no one answered."

### Conversion from JOS

Verbs with Aspect=perfective are converted to `Aspect=Perf`, verbs with Aspect=imperfective are converted `Aspect=Imp` and verbs with Aspect=biaspectual are not assigned the `Aspect` feature.
