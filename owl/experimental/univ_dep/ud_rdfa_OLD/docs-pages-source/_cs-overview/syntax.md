# Syntax

The tree structure and dependency relation labels in the Czech data have been obtained
by an automatic transformation of the PDT trees,
using dedicated scenarios within the
<a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex">Treex</a> NLP framework.

Several [language-specific subtypes](../dep/index.html)
of the [universal dependency relations](../../u/dep/index.html) have been defined
to preserve the information encoded in the original treebank.
