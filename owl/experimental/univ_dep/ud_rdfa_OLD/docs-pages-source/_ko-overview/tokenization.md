# Tokenization

The tokenization of the UD Korean Treebank follows the tokenization of the Korean data distributed by the [SPMRL 2013 shared task](http://www.spmrl.org/category/spmrl2013.html), which is a straightforward whitespace-based tokenization with conventional separation of punctuation. Each token can contain one or more morphemes separated by plus (`+`) signs.
