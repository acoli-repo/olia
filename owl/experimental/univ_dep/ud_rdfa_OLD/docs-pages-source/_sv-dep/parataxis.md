The parataxis relation (from Greek for "place side by side") is a relation between the main verb of a clause and other sentential elements, such as a sentential parenthetical, a clause after a ":" or a ";", or two sentences placed side by side without any explicit coordination or subordination. More information can be found on the universal dependency page ([u-dep/parataxis]())
