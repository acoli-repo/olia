`acl` is used for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a noun, including cases of secondary predication. 
Note that in Swedish relative clauses get assigned a specific relation [acl:relcl](), a subtype of `acl`.

Non-relative clausal dependents of nouns are limited to complement clauses with a subset of nouns like *faktum (fact)*.  We analyze them as `acl` (parallel to the analysis of this class as "content clauses" in Huddleston and Pullum 2002). Such clausal complements are usually finite (though there are occasional remnant Swedish subjunctives).

Hur förenas detta med det faktum att många äktenskap upplöses ? \n How can that be reconciled with the fact that many marriages break up?
acl(faktum, upplöses)

In addition, interrogative clauses can be linked to nouns by prepositions.

~~~ sdparse
En bild av vad som händer \n A picture of what happens
acl(bild, händer)

~~~ sdparse
Ta ansvar för vad du gör \n Take responsibility for what you do
acl(ansvar, gör)

The `acl` relation is also used for secondary predicates modifying a nominal.

~~~ sdparse
Han lämnade rummet gråtande . \n He left the room crying .
acl(Han, gråtande)
