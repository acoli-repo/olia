### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.
The names of people living in a place (such as _Les Am√©ricains_ "The Americans") should be tagged as `NOUN` (but this is not yet done consistently in the French data).

### Examples

- _Pierre_
- _ONU_
- _Mexique_
