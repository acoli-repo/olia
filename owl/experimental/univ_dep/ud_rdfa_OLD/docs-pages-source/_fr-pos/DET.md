### Definition
We follow the definition for `DET` proposed in the universal scheme.

However note that at the moment numerals are not consistently annotated as `NUM`, and are sometimes marked as `DET`.

For demonstratives such as _ce ...-là, ce ...-ci_ (as in _cet homme-ci, cette femme-là_ "this man, that women"), the first part of the determiner is annotated as `DET` and the clitic _ci, là_ (which are split from the noun) are marked as `PART`.

### Examples

- articles (a closed class indicating definiteness, specificity or givenness): _le, la, les_
- possessive determiners: _mon, ton, son, ma, ta, sa, mes, tes, ses, notre, votre, leur, nos, vos, leurs_
- demonstrative determiners: e.g., _ce, cet, cette_ as in _J'ai vu <b>ce</b> vélo hier._
- interrogative determiners: _quel, quelle_ as in _"<b>Quelle</b> couleur aimez-vous?"_
- relative determiners: _quel, quelle_ as in _"Je me demande <b>quelle</b> couleur vous aimez."_
- quantity/quantifier determiners: _aucun_, _tous_ (as in "tous les").
