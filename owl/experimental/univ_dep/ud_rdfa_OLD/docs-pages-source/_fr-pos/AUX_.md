### Definition

An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

French auxiliary verbs can be divided into tense auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries and passive auxiliaries.

### Delimitation

The exact delimitation of auxiliaries in French is not completely clear-cut, especially for the category of modal auxiliaries. In the French UD treebank, we have adopted a consensus solution based on the original Google annotation and the universal UD guidelines. Below we list the verbs that may appear in each group:

- Tense auxiliary: _aller_ (future périphrastique), _être_, _avoir_
- Modal auxiliary (+ infinitive): _savoir_, _pouvoir_, _devoir_, _vouloir_, _falloir_, _voir_, _aimer_, _souhaiter_
- Passive auxiliary: _être_, _aller_
