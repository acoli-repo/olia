FTB1 tokenization
=================

FTB1 has two tokens for those surface forms where a function word is fused with a following negative verb.
For example, "ellei" 'if not' is analyzed as "ell ei" where "ell" is considered the same as "jos" 'if'.

FTB1 contains a small number of proper names as multiword tokens.
