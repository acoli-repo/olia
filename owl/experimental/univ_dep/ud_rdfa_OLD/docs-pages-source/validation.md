- If you *can* see it on the [main page](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/), then it means that your readme file does not indicate the language should be included in the v1.2 release. All you need to do is to edit the readme following [these instructions](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/language_metadata.html)
- If you *cannot* see it on the main page, email ginter@cs.utu.fi
