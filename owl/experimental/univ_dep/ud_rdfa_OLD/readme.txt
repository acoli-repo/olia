The OLiA edition of the UD annotation guidelines was meant to be embedded as RDFa into the official documentation, generated from the same (semistructured) source Markdown as the HTML.
Early steps towards this are preserved here, the actual development took place on Filip Ginter's UD documentation branch (http://fginter.github.io/docs/).

While this works (and stil does on his site), it hasn't been taken over into the official UD version because the RDF generation occasionally fails. Apparently a synchronization bug in Jekyll.

For the time being, we provide links to this version.
