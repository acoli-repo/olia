...

Some semantic uses of focus are focus-sensitive particles (socalled
&#8216;association with focus&#8217; cases), negations, reason clauses and restrictors of quantifiers.

It is important to understand which subclasses of focus can be expressed by grammatical means, even if the distinction is only realized in a small group of languages. In the SFB annotation guidelines, &#8216;focus&#8217; is subcategorized into new and contrastive.

The pragmatic use of focus (or &#8216;management of CG&#8217;) does not
involve any change in the truth-value of the sentence. Only the semantic use of focus (or &#8216;content of CG&#8217;) has such an effect. Pragmatic uses of focus include answers to wh-questions, corrections, confirmations, parallel expressions and delimitations.

For given referents, different hierarchies of cognitive states and corresponding referring expressions have been proposed (e.g. Levelt 1989, Ariel 1990, Gundel et al. 1993, Chafe 1996). As these conceptualizations are, however, often incompatible with each other, I only propose one subcategory here, i.e. referents that are particularly prominent (salient, active, in focus).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The topic constituent identifies the entity or set of entities under which
the information expressed in the comment constituent should be stored in the CG content.

The notion of topic is best understood as a kind of address or file card which specifies the individual or set about which the remainder of the sentence makes a comment (see Reinhart 1981 for such a concept of topicality). It has no truthconditional effect except that it presupposes the existence of that individual. In this sense, the complement of &#8216;topic&#8217; is &#8216;comment,&#8217; which can itself be partitioned into a focused and a backgrounded part. Sentences usually have only one topic, but can also have none, or more than one. Following Jacobs (2001), topics can be aboutness or frame-setting topics, and the means to express a topic in the grammar can be pinpointed rather precisely in terms of which syntactic and intonational preferences the topic displays, at least in an intonation language. However, according to F&#233;ry&#8217;s theses, none of these properties are definitional for topic. Rather they express preferences as to how a &#8216;good&#8217; topic has to be realized (see also Jacobs 2001 for a similar view).
