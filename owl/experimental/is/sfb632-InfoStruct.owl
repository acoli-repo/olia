    >The solicited new-information focus is that part of a sentence that carries information explicitly requested by another discourse participant.
The focus domain in the answer differs according to the information already presupposed by the question.

An example for the all-focus sentences. These are answers to questions like “What’s new?”, “What’s going on?”

&lt;WORDS&gt;  What ’s that smell ?
&lt;NFocus&gt;  |  nf |

&lt;WORDS&gt; The kitchen is burning .
&lt;NFocus&gt; |             nf-sol            |


An example for a non-biased yes-no questions (also known as polar questions) and their answers are also cases of all-focus sentences since they are expressed to identify the truth-value of the entire proposition:

&lt;WORDS&gt;  Is this book in German ?
&lt;NFocus&gt;  |              nf                  |

&lt;WORDS&gt;  Yes, it is.
&lt;NFocus&gt;  |   nf-sol  |


An example for the VP-focus:

The focus is extended over the whole VP of the answer.

&lt;WORDS&gt;  What is Mary doing ?
&lt;NFocus&gt;  |   nf |

&lt;WORDS&gt; She is reading a book.
&lt;NFocus&gt;         |        nf-sol         |


An example for the narrow (XP-) focus:

The focus is extended over one constituent or on a part of a constituent only.

&lt;WORDS&gt; Who is reading a book ?
&lt;NFocus&gt; |  nf |

&lt;WORDS&gt;  Mary is reading a book.
&lt;NFocus&gt; |nf-sol|


An example for the discontinuous focus domain:

Instances of discontinuous focus domains are given when a question is so explicit that it asks for two or more non-adjacent parts of an utterance. The index shows that the parts annotated for focus belong to one and the same focus domain that is interrupted by discourse-given material. This is useful to distinguish cases of discontinuous focus domains from those of multiple foci. 

WORDS:  What did Paul do with the book.
NFocus:  [ _nf What ] did Paul do with the book.

WORDS: He gave it to Mary.
NFocus: He [ _ nf_1 gave] it [ _ nf_1 to Mary].

    >The objective of this annotation level is to annotate discourse referents for their information status in the discourse. “Discourse referents” are meant to comprise entities of many different types, that is individuals, places, times, events and situations, and sometimes even propositions. All these can be picked up by anaphoric expressions.

Their information status reflects their “retrievability”, which is meant to be understood as the difficulty of accessing the antecedent referent: a referent mentioned in the last sentence is easily accessible or “given”, whereas one that has to be inferred from world knowledge is only “accessible” to the degree that the inference relation is shared between speaker and hearer. A discourse referent which lacks an antecedent in the previous discourse, isn’t part of the discourse situation, nor is accessible via some relational reasoning has to be assumed to be “new”.

The units are constituents which refer to a discourse entities; mostly referential NPs or PPs, or their pronominal counterparts, unless they are part of an idiom.

    >That part of an expression which provides the most relevant information in a particular context as opposed to the (not so relevant) rest of information making up the background of the utterance. Typically, focus on a subexpression indicates that it is selected from possible alternatives that are either implicit or given explicitly, whereas the background can be derived from the context of the utterance.

Focus can extend over different domains in the utterance (like affixes, words, clause constituents, whole clause) and can be discontinuous as well. One expression can contain more than one focus.

Nf-unsol further applies to new relations between given discourse referents, i.e. to all sorts of predicates: verbal and nominal predicates, quantificational determiners (every, all, each, always, often etc.). 

To determine the domain of nf-unsol, use question-answer sequences assuming that for each sentence in a running text a preceding implicit question exists. That part of the sentence that supplies the new or missing information according to the implicit question is the information that carries the discourse further and has therefore to be annotated for nf-unsol.

    >Frame setting topics constitute the frame within which the main predication of the respective sentence has to be interpreted. They often specify the time or the location at which the event or state denoted by the rest of the clause takes place/holds. Temporal or locative PPs, adverbial phrases and subordinate clauses denoting (sets of) spatial or temporal locations are therefore typical frame setting topics crosslinguistically.

Frame-setting topics are typically fronted, and the spatial or temporal locations denoted by them are often already part of the shared background of the discourse participants, or can at least be inferred easily.

Furthermore, fronted adverbials denoting domains against which the subsequently reported fact is to be evaluated can be frame setting topics, too (Typical examples are adverbs like physically, mentally etc. in sentences like Physically, Peter is doing fine).

In some languages (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese) the choice is even wider: There, for example, constituents denoting supersets of the entities of which something is predicated in the subsequent clause can also be frame setting topics (see the Chinese example below). In languages like German and English, on the other hand, the same meaning can only be expressed by employing special constructions like Concerning X, S, As for X, S and Was X betrifft, S (where X is the frame setting topic, and S the subsequent clause).

WORDS: Gestern abend haben wir Skat gespielt.
GLOSS: Yesterday evening have we Skat played.
