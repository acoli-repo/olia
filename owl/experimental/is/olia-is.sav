        <rdfs:comment>Krifka distinguishes between &#8216;expression focus&#8217; and &#8216;denotation focus.&#8217; Differences in meaning are only found in the latter kind of focus, on which we concentrate here.

...

Some semantic uses of focus are focus-sensitive particles (socalled
&#8216;association with focus&#8217; cases), negations, reason clauses and restrictors of quantifiers.

It is important to understand which subclasses of focus can be expressed by grammatical means, even if the distinction is only realized in a small group of languages. In the SFB annotation guidelines, &#8216;focus&#8217; is subcategorized into new and contrastive.

        <rdfs:comment>Krifka distinguishes between &#8216;expression focus&#8217; and &#8216;denotation focus.&#8217; Differences in meaning are only found in the latter kind of focus, on which we concentrate here. 

The pragmatic use of focus (or &#8216;management of CG&#8217;) does not
involve any change in the truth-value of the sentence. Only the semantic use of focus (or &#8216;content of CG&#8217;) has such an effect. Pragmatic uses of focus include answers to wh-questions, corrections, confirmations, parallel expressions and delimitations.

interpretation of linguistic expressions.
(F&#233;ry et al. 2007)

That part of an expression which provides the most relevant information in a particular context as opposed to the (not so relevant) rest of information making up the background of the utterance. Typically, focus on a subexpression indicates that it is selected from possible alternatives that are either implicit or given explicitly, whereas the background can be derived from the context of the utterance. (SFB632 Guidelines)

Foci are classified here according to their discourse function (independently from their structural realization).</rdfs:comment>

As these conceptualizations are, however, often incompatible with each other, I only propose one subcategory here, i.e. referents that are particularly prominent (salient, active, in focus).</rdfs:comment>

predicate is the host of two major functions relating to focus

(b) it identifies/selects a state of affairs

...

avoid the term &quot;predicate focus&quot;, as it is multiply ambiguous:

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">&quot;Topic&quot; is a prominent notion in pragmatics, though often with varying definitions. For detailed definitions, compare the sub-classes.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>The topic constituent identifies the entity or set of entities under which
the information expressed in the comment constituent should be stored in the CG content.

The notion of topic is best understood as a kind of address or file card which specifies the individual or set about which the remainder of the sentence makes a comment (see Reinhart 1981 for such a concept of topicality). It has no truthconditional effect except that it presupposes the existence of that individual. In this sense, the complement of &#8216;topic&#8217; is &#8216;comment,&#8217; which can itself be partitioned into a focused and a backgrounded part. Sentences usually have only one topic, but can also have none, or more than one. Following Jacobs (2001), topics can be aboutness or frame-setting topics, and the means to express a topic in the grammar can be pinpointed rather precisely in terms of which syntactic and intonational preferences the topic displays, at least in an intonation language. However, according to F&#233;ry&#8217;s theses, none of these properties are definitional for topic. Rather they express preferences as to how a &#8216;good&#8217; topic has to be realized (see also Jacobs 2001 for a similar view).
