Universal POS tags (Petrov et al. 2011), mapped to OLiA

cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2086 and https://github.com/slavpetrov/universal-pos-tags

Note that these linking models are reductionist and significantly shallower than OLiA annotation models, we thus only transfer linking models into the stable branch 
for which no previous linking did exist.
