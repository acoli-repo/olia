# DatCatInfo

DatCatInfo is the ISOcat successor system currently developed within ISO TC37/SC4 accfording to ISO 12620:2019.
The official home is http://www.datcatinfo.net/, but it currently (July 2020) does not seem to be possible to reach *any* DCR content from the offical entry point (http://www.datcatinfo.net/). In particular, the link to the DatCatInfo Database (http://demo.termweb.se/termweb/app) is not operational.

A static, internal dump is available from http://isocat.tbxinfo.net/rest/user/guest/workspace, but according to personal consultation with DCR maintainers (July 2020), this is an out-dated copy and must not be used.

The actual data can be accessed and searched via TermWeb: https://datcatinfo.termweb.se/termweb/app. TermWeb provides HTML and PDF export (of individual concepts only). A TBX export is foreseen, but currently not publicly available. In the longer perspective, it is expected that DatCatInfo URIs (e.g., http://datcatinfo.termweb.se/datcat/DC-329) resolve. This functionality is not in place yet, but a mapping from PIDs to (resolvable) internal identifiers is given with the mapping file provided in this repository.
