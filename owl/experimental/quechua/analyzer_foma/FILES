 Short description of the project files
----------------------------------------

1. Lexica:
----------

nominal:
nroot.foma - contains the nominal roots
nroot-with-translations.foma - contains the nominal roots with the corresponding Spanish translations
nroot-cmp.foma - contains the roots that are allowed as second part of nominal compounds (those need to be restricted instead of allowing all roots from nroot.foma, as this would lead to many wrong analyses).
nroot-cmp-with-translations.foma - same as above, but with the corresponding Spanish translations
nroot-es.foma - contains some of the frequently used Spanish loan words (nouns)
nroot-indef.foma - contains indefinite (pro-) nouns
nroot-indef-with-translations.foma - contains indefinite (pro-) nouns with the corresponding Spanish translations
nroot-num.foma - contains numerals
nroot-num-with-translations.foma - contains numerals with the corresponding Spanish translations

verbal:
vroot.foma - contains the verbal roots
vroot-with-translations.foma - contains the verbal roots with the corresponding Spanish translations
vroot-trans.foma - contains transitive verb roots (may incorporate a nominal root)
vroot-trans-with-translations.foma - same as above, but with the corresponding Spanish translations
vroot-es.foma - contains some of the frequently used Spanish loan words (verbs)
vroot-copula.foma - contains the copula

particles:
particle.foma - contains non-verbalizable particles
particle-verb.foma - contains verbalizable particles

pronouns:
prndem.foma - contains the demonstrative pronouns
prninterrog.foma - contains the interrogative pronouns
prnpers.foma - contains the personal pronouns

lexicon-sp.foma - contains some Spanish foreign words, extracted automatically with the Spanish TreeTagger from some sample Quechua texts

special lexica:
letra.foma - contains the possible letters of Quechua texts (including letters that may ocurr in Spanish loans)
punctuation.foma - contains the punctuation marks the analyzer should be able to handle (not exhaustive!)


2. Suffixes:
------------

as-*.foma - the so-called 'ambivalent' or independent suffixes, that can be attached to both nominal or verbal word forms
v-v-*.foma - verbal suffixes
n-n-*.foma - nominal suffixes
n-v.foma - verbalizing suffixes
v-n.foma - nominalizing suffixes
v-n.final - nominalizing suffixes, nominalization with these suffixes is 'final', the resulting word form can not be verbalized again (e.g. converbs)
hon-aff.foma - honorific/affective suffix -lla, actually one of the as-suffixes, but it may ocurr its position within the word is relatively free and not even restricted to the end of the word
ntin-wan.foma - contains the suffixes -ntin (inclusive), -wan (instrumental) and -kama (in its distributive function), as these are (to my knowlegde) the only suffixes that may be attached to converbial forms in -spa or -pti.
numord.foma - contains all the variations of the marker for ordinal numerals


3. Scripts:
-----------

quechua.foma - scriptfile that combines all the described foma-files with the language data into a single description of quechua morphology
quechua-with-translations.foma - same as above, but gives the Spanish translations for the Quechua roots
tokenize.pl - very simple perl script to tokenize quechua input texts
Makefile - Makefile with the following targets: 

make analysed.txt - produces a list of all the tokens with their morphological analysis:

Suyupa 		NRoot+Gen
Hatun   	NRoot
Rimanakuynin    VRoot+Rzpr+Rflx_Int+Inf+3.Sg.Poss
Acuerdo 	SP
Nacional        SP
nisqa   	VRoot+3.Sg.IPst
nisqa   	VRoot+Perf

make analysed-trans.txt - does the same, but gives the Spanish translations of the Quechua roots in the analysis output

make failures.txt - creates a list of all the tokens in the text that were not recognized by the transducer
