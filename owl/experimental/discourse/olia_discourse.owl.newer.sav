    >A classical discourse relation that has been applied to different kinds of dependency relations, e.g., between a set and its member(s), an abstraction and its instance(s), whole and part, process and step, object and attribute, or generalization and specific.
Since Knott et al. (2001), it seems generally accepted that elaboration is to be circumscribed by entity-based coherence, e.g., EntRel relationships as defined by Prasad et al. (2007): "no discourse relation can be inferred and where the second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first sentence".</rdfs:comment>

on a portion or part of the nucleus. Since this relation is most often appropriate for representing
parts of objects, it is only occasionally found to hold between EDUs. Most typically, this would be
in a parenthetical modifier. It is distinguished from ELABORATION-SET-MEMBER, in which each

In a CONDITION relation, the truth of the proposition associated with the nucleus is a consequence of the fulfillment of the condition in the satellite. The satellite presents a situation that is not realized. (Carlson and Marcu 2001)</rdfs:comment>

    >In a BACKGROUND relation, the satellite establishes the context or the grounds
with respect to which the nucleus is to be interpreted. Understanding the satellite helps the reader
understand the nucleus. The satellite IS NOT the cause/reason/motivation of the situation pre-
sented in the nucleus. The reader/writer intentions are irrelevant in determining whether such a
relation holds. In contrast with the CIRCUMSTANCE relation, the information or the context of the
BACKGROUND relation is not always specified clearly or delimited sharply. Hence, the CIRCUM-
STANCE relation is stronger than BACKGROUND. Often, in a BACKGROUND relation, the events rep-
resented in the nucleus and the satellite occur at distinctly different times, whereas events in a
CIRCUMSTANCE relation are somewhat co-temporal.

The most frequent structural pattern is that two spans of text (virtually always adjacent, but exceptions can be found) are related such that one of them has a specific role relative to the other. A paradigm case is a claim followed by evidence for the claim. RST posits an "Evidence" relation between the two spans. It also says that the claim is more essential to the text than the particular evidence, and this essentiality is represented by calling the claim span a nucleus and the evidence span a satellite.

(Carlson and Marcu 2001)

Verbs of attribution are negated on the surface - syntactically (e.g., didn’t say, don’t think) or lexically (e.g., denied), and the negation reverses the polarity of the attributed relation or argument content (Horn, 1978). The interpretation of the contrastive relation denoted by but requires that Arg2 should be interpreted under the scope of negation.

ATTRIBUTE-E and ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E is that the former is intrinsic to the object it is
modifying in the nucleus, while the latter is extrinsic, i.e. it contains information that is incidental
and which could be omitted without loss of understanding. Usually, an ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is separated from the nucleus by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative
clause, whereas an ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E represents a restrictive relative clause.

It is subjective, presenting the personal opinion of the writer or of a third party.

A LIST is a multinuclear relation whose elements can be listed, but which are not in a comparison, contrast or other, stronger type of multinuclear relation. A LIST relation usually exhibits some sort of parallel structure between the units involved in the relation. At lower levels of the discourse structure, such as between clauses or sentences, a LIST relation is often selected when there is some sort of parallel syntactic or semantic structure between the units, such as in the examples below. At higher levels of the discourse structure, the relation may be found when there are paragraphs of items enumerated in a similar fashion.

In order to distangle discourse-syntactic (paratactic/hypotactic) and functional-semantic aspects, DiscourseRelation is distinguished from DiscourseStructuralPattern: DiscourseRelations defined discourse relations in terms of their communicative function and underlying semantics. An RST antithesis, for example, is thus to be defined both as a ContrastRelation (subclass of DiscourseRelation) and as a HypotacticDiscourseRelation (subclass of DiscourseStructuralPattern).
