    >OLiA ontology for discourse annotation, i.e.
	- discourse relations (coherence relations)
	- discourse structure
	- coreference and bridging
	- information structure
	
	This ontology does not extend to 
	- lexical semantics (covered by extensive specialized vocabularies, e.g., WordNet, FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- semantic roles (covered covered by specialized vocabularies, e.g., FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- implicit semantic roles (do not require a specialized vocabulary, this is merely the intersentential application of semantic roles)
	- dialog acts (yet to come)
	- speech acts (yet to come)
	- syntax, morphosyntax, morphology (OLiA Reference Model)
	- SDRT (annotated corpora for SDRT are currently in preparation, but not yet available. SDRT is thus not considered here.)

    >R recognizes S as providing additional detail for N. R identifies the element of subject matter for which detail is provided. (Mann and Taboada 2010)
Infer a set of coherent entities, E(DS0, DS1) from DS0 and DS1. The members of E(DS0, DS1) are centered around a common event or entity, e01. (Wolf et al. 2003)

A classical discourse relation that has been applied to different kinds of dependency relations, e.g., between a set and its member(s), an abstraction and its instance(s), whole and part, process and step, object and attribute, or generalization and specific.
Since Knott et al. (2001), it seems generally accepted that elaboration is to be circumscribed by entity-based coherence, e.g., EntRel relationships as defined by Prasad et al. (2007): "no discourse relation can be inferred and where the second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first sentence".

Although Elaboration is thus closely entangled with anaphora and textual inferences, both phenomena are to be modelled separately: Elaboration is a relationship between discourse segments, whereas anaphora and bridging are relationships between discourse referents.

Cf. Contrast as defined by Wolf et al. (2003): Infer a set of entities from DS0, E(DS0), and a set of entities from DS1, E(DS1). Then infer contrasts between members of E(DS0) and E(DS1).
• Contrast-1 is a contrast between corresponding predicates in DS0 and DS1. The
arguments of these contrasting predicates are identical.
• Contrast-2 is a contrast between the arguments of corresponding predicates in DS0

    >Subordinating or Mononuclear Relations (RST):
The most frequent structural pattern is that two spans of text (virtually always adjacent, but exceptions can be found) are related such that one of them has a specific role relative to the other. A paradigm case is a claim followed by evidence for the claim. RST posits an "Evidence" relation between the two spans. It also says that the claim is more essential to the text than the particular evidence, and this essentiality is represented by calling the claim span a nucleus and the evidence span a satellite.

    >In interpretation relations, one side of the relation gives a different perspective on the situation presented in the other side. It is subjective, presenting the personal opinion of the writer or of a third party. An interpretation can be: 1) an explanation of what is not immediately plain or explicit; 2) an explanation of actions, events, or statements by pointing out or suggesting inner relationships, motives, or by relating particulars to general principles; or 3) an understanding or appreciation of a situation in light of individual belief, judgment, interest, or circumstance.

Arg1 and Arg2 are members of a list, defined in the prior discourse. “List” does not require the situations specified in Arg1 and Arg2 to be directly related. (Prasad et al. 2007)

A LIST is a multinuclear relation whose elements can be listed, but which are not in a comparison, contrast or other, stronger type of multinuclear relation. A LIST relation usually exhibits some sort of parallel structure between the units involved in the relation. At lower levels of the discourse structure, such as between clauses or sentences, a LIST relation is often selected when there is some sort of parallel syntactic or semantic structure between the units, such as in the examples below. At higher levels of the discourse structure, the relation may be found when there are paragraphs of items enumerated in a similar fashion.

    >A pseudo-relation used as a device for linking two discontinuous text fragments that are really a single EDU, but which are broken up by an embedded unit. Examples of embedded units that can break up other EDUs include: relative clauses, other nominal postmodifiers, parentheticals, participial clauses, etc. By convention, this relation is always multinuclear.

Some semantic uses of focus are focus-sensitive particles (socalled
&#8216;association with focus&#8217; cases), negations, reason clauses and restrictors of quantifiers.

It is important to understand which subclasses of focus can be expressed by grammatical means, even if the distinction is only realized in a small group of languages. In the SFB annotation guidelines, &#8216;focus&#8217; is subcategorized into new and contrastive.

The pragmatic use of focus (or &#8216;management of CG&#8217;) does not
involve any change in the truth-value of the sentence. Only the semantic use of focus (or &#8216;content of CG&#8217;) has such an effect. Pragmatic uses of focus include answers to wh-questions, corrections, confirmations, parallel expressions and delimitations.

For given referents, different hierarchies of cognitive states and corresponding referring expressions have been proposed (e.g. Levelt 1989, Ariel 1990, Gundel et al. 1993, Chafe 1996). As these conceptualizations are, however, often incompatible with each other, I only propose one subcategory here, i.e. referents that are particularly prominent (salient, active, in focus).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The topic constituent identifies the entity or set of entities under which
the information expressed in the comment constituent should be stored in the CG content.

The notion of topic is best understood as a kind of address or file card which specifies the individual or set about which the remainder of the sentence makes a comment (see Reinhart 1981 for such a concept of topicality). It has no truthconditional effect except that it presupposes the existence of that individual. In this sense, the complement of &#8216;topic&#8217; is &#8216;comment,&#8217; which can itself be partitioned into a focused and a backgrounded part. Sentences usually have only one topic, but can also have none, or more than one. Following Jacobs (2001), topics can be aboutness or frame-setting topics, and the means to express a topic in the grammar can be pinpointed rather precisely in terms of which syntactic and intonational preferences the topic displays, at least in an intonation language. However, according to F&#233;ry&#8217;s theses, none of these properties are definitional for topic. Rather they express preferences as to how a &#8216;good&#8217; topic has to be realized (see also Jacobs 2001 for a similar view).
