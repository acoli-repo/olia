        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">OLiA ontology for discourse annotation, i.e.
	- discourse relations (coherence relations)
	- discourse structure
	- coreference and bridging
	- information structure
	
	This ontology does not extend to 
	- lexical semantics (covered by extensive specialized vocabularies, e.g., WordNet, FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- semantic roles (covered covered by specialized vocabularies, e.g., FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- implicit semantic roles (do not require a specialized vocabulary, this is merely the intersentential application of semantic roles)
	- dialog acts (yet to come)
	- speech acts (yet to come)
	- syntax, morphosyntax, morphology (OLiA Reference Model)
	- SDRT (annotated corpora for SDRT are currently in preparation, but not yet available. SDRT is thus not considered here.)

the agent(s) holding or making them (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004, 2005).
(Prasad et al. 2007)

Instances of reported speech, both direct and indirect, should be marked for
the rhetorical relation of ATTRIBUTION. The satellite is the source of the attribution (a clause con-
taining a reporting verb, or a phrase beginning with according to), and the nucleus is the content
of the reported message (which must be in a separate clause). The ATTRIBUTION relation is also
used with cognitive predicates, to include feelings, thoughts, hopes, etc.

The Satellite attributes the Nucleus to a source.

BACKGROUND relation is not always specified clearly or delimited sharply. Hence, the CIRCUM-

...

Some semantic uses of focus are focus-sensitive particles (socalled
‘association with focus’ cases), negations, reason clauses and restrictors of quantifiers.

It is important to understand which subclasses of focus can be expressed by grammatical means, even if the distinction is only realized in a small group of languages. In the SFB annotation guidelines, ‘focus’ is subcategorized into new and contrastive.

In order to distangle discourse-syntactic (paratactic/hypotactic) and functional-semantic aspects, DiscourseRelation is distinguished from DiscourseStructuralPattern: DiscourseRelations defined discourse relations in terms of their communicative function and underlying semantics. An RST antithesis, for example, is thus to be defined both as a ContrastRelation (subclass of DiscourseRelation) and as a HypotacticDiscourseRelation (subclass of DiscourseStructuralPattern).

Infer a set of coherent entities, E(DS0, DS1) from DS0 and DS1. The members of E(DS0, DS1) are centered around a common event or entity, e01. (Wolf et al. 2003)

A classical discourse relation that has been applied to different kinds of dependency relations, e.g., between a set and its member(s), an abstraction and its instance(s), whole and part, process and step, object and attribute, or generalization and specific.
Since Knott et al. (2001), it seems generally accepted that elaboration is to be circumscribed by entity-based coherence, e.g., EntRel relationships as defined by Prasad et al. (2007): &quot;no discourse relation can be inferred and where the second sentence only serves to provide some further description of an entity in the first sentence&quot;.

Although Elaboration is thus closely entangled with anaphora and textual inferences, both phenomena are to be modelled separately: Elaboration is a relationship between discourse segments, whereas anaphora and bridging are relationships between discourse referents.

all levels of the discourse structure, and is especially popular to show relations across large spans of information. It is the default for the family of elaboration relations, and should be used when
none of the other, more specific, elaboration relations apply.

When an elaborating satellite is an embedded unit, the relation ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is used. Generally, the embedded satellite of this relation is separated from the nucleus
by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative clause, whereas an ELABORATION-OBJECT-

intrinsic to the meaning of the nucleus, and/or essential to understanding the context, and is
almost always an embedded unit. This relation is almost always embedded

In embedded units, ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is much more common than
ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E. The way to distinguish between ELABORATION-OBJECT-
ATTRIBUTE-E and ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL-E is that the former is intrinsic to the object it is
modifying in the nucleus, while the latter is extrinsic, i.e. it contains information that is incidental
and which could be omitted without loss of understanding. Usually, an ELABORATION-ADDI-
TIONAL-E is separated from the nucleus by a comma and represents a nonrestrictive relative

        <rdfs:comment>Krifka distinguishes between ‘expression focus’ and ‘denotation focus.’ Differences in meaning are only found in the latter kind of focus, on which we concentrate here. 

The pragmatic use of focus (or ‘management of CG’) does not
involve any change in the truth-value of the sentence. Only the semantic use of focus (or ‘content of CG’) has such an effect. Pragmatic uses of focus include answers to wh-questions, corrections, confirmations, parallel expressions and delimitations.

The most frequent structural pattern is that two spans of text (virtually always adjacent, but exceptions can be found) are related such that one of them has a specific role relative to the other. A paradigm case is a claim followed by evidence for the claim. RST posits an &quot;Evidence&quot; relation between the two spans. It also says that the claim is more essential to the text than the particular evidence, and this essentiality is represented by calling the claim span a nucleus and the evidence span a satellite.

Arg1 and Arg2 are members of a list, defined in the prior discourse. “List” does not require the situations specified in Arg1 and Arg2 to be directly related. (Prasad et al. 2007)

A LIST is a multinuclear relation whose elements can be listed, but which are not in a comparison, contrast or other, stronger type of multinuclear relation. A LIST relation usually exhibits some sort of parallel structure between the units involved in the relation. At lower levels of the discourse structure, such as between clauses or sentences, a LIST relation is often selected when there is some sort of parallel syntactic or semantic structure between the units, such as in the examples below. At higher levels of the discourse structure, the relation may be found when there are paragraphs of items enumerated in a similar fashion.

The notion of Markable is somewhat problematic in its relation to DiscourseSegment. An RST elementary discourse unit (discourse segment) is basically a markable (almost-arbitrary plain String) together with a label, but an SDRT discourse segment is a structured semantic entity. Here, we remain agnostic. It is thus possible to define a joint subclass of DiscourseSegment and Markable for RST, for example.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">Suggested as an extension of the PDTB scheme by Oza et al. (2009).

Each pragmatic sense at the type level is
further distinguished into three subtypes: “epis-
temic” (Sweetser 1990), “speech-act” (Sweetser
1990), and “propositional”. The propositional
subtype involves the inference of a complete
proposition. The relation is then taken to hold
between this inferred proposition and the propo-
sitional content of one of the arguments.

        <rdfs:comment>The topic constituent identifies the entity or set of entities under which
the information expressed in the comment constituent should be stored in the CG content.

The notion of topic is best understood as a kind of address or file card which specifies the individual or set about which the remainder of the sentence makes a comment (see Reinhart 1981 for such a concept of topicality). It has no truthconditional effect except that it presupposes the existence of that individual. In this sense, the complement of ‘topic’ is ‘comment,’ which can itself be partitioned into a focused and a backgrounded part. Sentences usually have only one topic, but can also have none, or more than one. Following Jacobs (2001), topics can be aboutness or frame-setting topics, and the means to express a topic in the grammar can be pinpointed rather precisely in terms of which syntactic and intonational preferences the topic displays, at least in an intonation language. However, according to Féry’s theses, none of these properties are definitional for topic. Rather they express preferences as to how a ‘good’ topic has to be realized (see also Jacobs 2001 for a similar view).
