    >OLiA ontology for discourse annotation, i.e.
	- discourse relations (coherence relations)
	- discourse structure
	- coreference and bridging
	- information structure
	
	This ontology does not extend to 
	- lexical semantics (covered by extensive specialized vocabularies, e.g., WordNet, FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- semantic roles (covered covered by specialized vocabularies, e.g., FrameNet, for which RDF instantiations already exist)
	- implicit semantic roles (do not require a specialized vocabulary, this is merely the intersentential application of semantic roles)
	- dialog acts (yet to come)
	- speech acts (yet to come)
	- syntax, morphosyntax, morphology (OLiA Reference Model)
