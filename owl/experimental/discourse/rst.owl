    >Annotation Model for Rhetorical Structure Theory as defined by Mann and Taboada (2010), resp. Mann and Thompson (1988)

RST was originally developed as part of studies of computer-based text generation. A team at Information Sciences Institute (part of University of Southern California) was working on computer-based authoring. In about 1983, part of the team (Bill Mann, Sandy Thompson and Christian Matthiessen) noted that there was no available theory of discourse structure or function that provided enough detail to guide programming any sort of author. Responding to this lack, RST was developed out of studies of edited or carefully prepared text from a wide variety of sources. It now has a status in linguistics that is independent of its computational uses. 

RST generally provides an analysis for any coherent carefully written text, and because such an analysis provides a motivated account of why each element of the text has been included by the author, it gives an account of textual coherence that is independent of the lexical and grammatical forms of the text. Because of its specification of the role of the observer, it provides a basis for statements about the objectivity and subjectivity of the analysis. It also provides a functional basis for studying the discourse-relevant specific forms in texts, "discourse markers" and other formal correlates of discourse structure. Where RST posits structure within sentences, it provides a basis for studying the functions of various forms of clause combining, and more generally the relationships between these sorts of discourse structure and various cohesive devices.

    >The most frequent structural pattern is that two spans of text (virtually always adjacent, but exceptions can be found) are related such that one of them has a specific role relative to the other. A paradigm case is a claim followed by evidence for the claim. RST posits an "Evidence" relation between the two spans. It also says that the claim is more essential to the text than the particular evidence, and this essentiality is represented by calling the claim span a nucleus and the evidence span a satellite. The order of spans is not constrained, but there are more likely and less likely orders for all of the relations. ...

The set of relations is in principle open, but the set (...) defined in Mann &amp; Thompson 1988 (which is currently the definitive paper on RST) has proven effective for many purposes. (...) a distinction is made between Subject-Matter relations and Presentational relations. Subject-Matter relations express parts of the subject matter of the text.

On terminology in definitions: N stands for nucleus, S for satellite, W for writer (author, speaker) and R for reader (hearer.) For some brevity: in many places, N and S stand for the situations presented by N and S; N and S never stand for the text of N or S. Situation is a broad cover term that ranges over propositions or beliefs, actions whether realized or not, desires to act and approval for another to act. Similarly, positive regard is a broad attitudinal term that ranges over belief, approval of ideas, desire to act, and approval for another to act, all identifiably positive. Positive regard and belief (with its cognates), and plausible above are all degree terms, not binary.
