**Discourse markers annotation scheme**

-   **Semantic annotation**

When the DM conveys a semantic value, use the following DR-core
relations.

1.  Identify DR relation.

2.  For the asymmetric relations, identify semantic role of Arg1 and
    Arg2.

  **Attribution**   It is a relation between agents and situations, which
                    identifies the agent to whom the utterance is attributed
                    (the writer or other agent in the text). In this case, only
                    the attribution phrase should be identified, and not the
                    arguments. Frequently, it co-occurs with other discourse
                    relations.

When the DM carries a pragmatic value, use a plug-in to dialogue acts
(DA)

1.  Identify communicative function.

2.  Whenever necessary, identify qualifiers.
