        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">Because there are no generally accepted abstract semantic categories for classifying the arguments
to discourse connectives as have been suggested for verbs (e.g., agent, patient, theme, etc.), the
two arguments to a discourse connective are simply labelled Arg2, for the argument that appears
in the clause that is syntactically bound to the connective, and Arg1, for the other argument.

denied), but where the negation in fact reverses the polarity of the attributed relation or argument
content (Horn, 1978). Example (162) illustrates such a case. The but clause entails an interpretation
such as I think it’s not a main consideration, for which the negation must take narrow scope over the
embedded clause rather than the higher clause. In particular, the interpretation of the contrastive
relation denoted by but requires that Arg2 should be interpreted under the scope of negation.
(162) “Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but
I don’t think it’s a main consideration,” he says. (0090)

To capture such entailments with surface negations on attribution verbs, an argument of a connective
is marked “Neg” for scopal polarity when the interpretation of the connective requires the surface
negation to take semantic scope over the lower argument. Thus, in Example (162), scopal polarity is
marked as “Neg” for Arg2.

considered event, state or action. Eventuality AOs occur with “control” types of attribution (“Ctrl”
for short), conveyed by any of three different classes of control verbs (Sag and Pollard, 1991). The
first kind is anchored by a verb of influence like persuade, permit, order, and involve one agent
influencing another agent to perform (or not perform) an action. The second kind is anchored by a
verb of commitment like promise, agree, try, intend, refuse, decline, and involve an agent committing
to perform (or not perform) an action. The third kind is anchored by a verb of orientation like want,
expect, wish, yearn, and involve desire, expectation, or some similar mental orientation towards some
state(s) of affairs. These sub-distinctions are not encoded in the annotation, but we have used the
definitions as a guide for identifying these predicates.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">In the absence of an independent occurrence of attribution on an argument, as for Arg2 of Example (158), a “Null” value for the type on the argument means that it needs to be derived by independent (here, undefined) considerations under the scope of the relation. 

(158) When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the State in June 1983, he says Judge O’Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000. (0267)

Note that unlike the “Inh” value of the source feature, “Null” does not indicate inheritance. In a subordinate clause, for example, while the relation denoted by the subordinating conjunction may be asserted, the clause content itself may be “presupposed”, as seems to be the case in (158). However, we found these differences difficult to determine at times, and consequently leave this undefined in the scheme.

established between Arg1 and Arg2 in order to highlight prominent differences between the two situ-
ations. Semantically, the truth of both arguments is independent of the connective or the established
relation. “COMPARISON” has two types to further specify its semantics. In some cases, Arg1 and
Arg2 share a predicate or a property and the difference is highlighted with respect to the values
assigned to this property. This interpretation is tagged with the type “Contrast”. There are also
cases in which the highlighted differences are related to expectations raised by one argument which
are then denied by the other. This intepretation is tagged with the type “Concession”.</rdfs:comment>

Arg2 are causally influenced and the two are not in a conditional relation.
The rough formal semantics of “Cause” follows Giordano and Schwind (2004) in modelling causality
with the binary operator &lt; such that A&lt;B models the causal law “A causes B”.17 Here A and B are
drawn from the situations described in ||Arg1|| and ||Arg2||. Unless the connective and its arguments
are embedded in a matrix that alters their truth value, the situations denoted by A and B and the
causal relation between them are all taken to hold.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">The type “Concession” applies when the connective indicates that one of the arguments describes a
situation A which causes C, while the other asserts (or implies) ЌC. Alternatively, one argument
denotes a fact that triggers a set of potential consequences, while the other denies one or more of
them. Formally: A&lt;C ∧ B→ЌC, where A and B are drawn from ||Arg1|| and ||Arg2||. (ЌC may be
the same as B, where B→B is always true.)
Two “Concession” subtypes are defined in terms of the argument creating an expectation and the
one denying it. Specifically, when Arg2 creates an expectation that Arg1 denies (A=||Arg2|| and
B=||Arg1||), it is tagged as “expectation”. When Arg1 creates an expectation that
Arg2 denies (A=||Arg1|| and B=||Arg2||), it is tagged as “contra-expectation”.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">The type “Condition” is used to describe all subtypes of conditional relations. In addition to causal
influence, “Condition” allows some basic inferences about the semantic contribution of the arguments.
Specifically, the situation in Arg2 is taken to be the condition and the situation described in Arg1
is taken to be the consequence, i.e., the situation that holds when the condition is true. Unlike
“Cause”, however, the truth value of the arguments of a “Condition” relation cannot be determined
independently of the connective.
For this reason, we introduce some branching-time logic operators into our rough description of the
semantics of “Condition” subtypes: A, F, and G. A universally quantifies over all possible futures;
therefore, Aβ is true iff β is true in all possible futures. F and G are respectively existential and
universal quantifiers over instants in a single future: Fα is true iff α is true in some instant in a
possible future, while Gα is true iff α is true in every instant in a possible future</rdfs:comment>

Connectives inserted in this way to express inferred relations are called Implicit connectives. Multiple discourse relations (Webber et al., 1999) can also be inferred, and are annotated by inserting multiple Implicit connectives.

The goal of annotating Implicit connectives in the PDTB is to capture relations between abstract
objects that are not realized explicitly in the text (by one of a set of the lexically-defined Explicit
connectives) and are left to be inferred by the reader.</rdfs:comment>

in the opposite direction (i.e., with Arg2 expressing the claim and Arg1 the justification), we allow
for this by making “justification” a subtype. However, currently no semantic distinction is made
between the type “Pragmatic” and the subtype “justification”.

the contrast is between Arg1 and the inference that quantity isn’t the only thing that needs to be
explained with respect to producers now creating appealing wines: Quality needs to be explained as
well, cf. Arg2.
(118) “It’s just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people,” added Larry Shapiro. “They
like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace one of Diamond Creek’s Cabernets or
the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus. Producers have seen this market opening up and
they’re now creating wines that appeal to these people.” That explains why the number of
these wines is expanding so rapidly. But consumers who buy at this level are also more
knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. (COMPARISON:Pragmatic Contrast)

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">Senses have been annotated in the form of sense tags for Explicit and Implicit connectives, and AltLex relations. The tagset of senses is organized hierarchically. The top level, or class level, has four tags representing four major semantic classes:“TEMPORAL”, “CONTINGENCY”, “COMPARISON” and “EXPANSION”.
The hierarchical organization of the sense tags serves two purposes. First, it allows the annotations
to be more flexible and thus more reliable. This is because the annotators can choose to annotate
at a level that is comfortable to them: they are not forced to provide finer semantic descriptions
than they are confident about or which the context does not sufficiently disambiguate. Secondly, the
hierarchical organization of tags also allows useful inferences at all levels.

Connectives can also be used to relate the use of the arguments of a connective to one another
or the use of one argument with the sense of the other. For these rhetorical or pragmatic uses of
connectives, we have defined pragmatic sense tags – specifically, “Pragmatic Cause”, “Pragmatic
Condition”, “Pragmatic Contrast” and “Pragmatic Concession”.</rdfs:comment>

“hypothetical”. Besides asserting the condition between the two arguments, it also asserts that
||Arg2|| holds true or is believed by someone to hold true. (If ||Arg2|| indeed holds true, then ||Arg1|| is caused to be true.) We can represent that ||Arg2|| is believed by someone to hold true
by means of an epistemic operator Bel(||Arg2||). Therefore, the semantics for factual present is

truth about the world or a statement that describes a regular outcome every time the condition holds
true. Its semantics is then AG(||Arg2|| &lt; ||Arg1||): in all possible futures, it is always the case that
||Arg2|| causes ||Arg1||. The verbs in Arg1 and Arg2 are typically in present and future tenses.

the connective “because” are labelled as “Pragmatic cause:justification”. While no instances have
been found in the corpus of an Explicit or Implicit connective in which “Pragmatic cause” holds
in the opposite direction (i.e., with Arg2 expressing the claim and Arg1 the justification), we allow
for this by making “justification” a subtype. However, currently no semantic distinction is made
between the type “Pragmatic” and the subtype “justification”.

the values assigned to some shared property are the extremes of a gradable scale, e.g., tall-short,

Note that the notion of gradable scale used in distinguishing “opposition” from “juxtaposition”
strongly depends on the context where the sentence is uttered. For example, consider the pair black-
white. These two concepts are usually taken to be antonyms. Therefore, it seems that whenever
Arg1 assigns ‘black’ and Arg2 assigns ‘white’ to a shared property (e.g. Mary is black whereas John
is white), the discourse connective has to be labelled as “opposition”. However, in many contexts
‘black’ and ‘white’ are just two of the colors that may be assigned to the shared property (e.g., take
the sentence Mary bought a black hat whereas John bought a white one uttered in a shop that sells
red, yellow and blue hats as well). In such cases, they are not antonyms, and the connective is
labelled as “juxtaposition”.</rdfs:comment>
