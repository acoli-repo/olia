    >The data structure is a directed graph where nodes represent discourse segments and groups of

DSs are non-overlapping units of text.

As a basic rule, discourse segments (DSs) here will be assumed to be
•
clauses delimited by commas or full-stops, since commas and full-stops are assumed to be
equivalents of phrase boundaries in speech (cf. Hirschberg &amp; Grosz (1992))
•
elements of text (especially modifiers) that are separated by commas. The idea here is that
commas that are equivalent to intonational phrase boundaries in speech should denote DSs.
•
attributions, as in “John said that…”. This is empirically motivated. The texts used here are
taken from news corpora, and there, attributions can be important carriers of coherence
structures. For instance, consider a case where some Source A and some Source B both
comment on some Event X. It should be possible to distinguish between a situation where
Source A and Source B make basically the same statement about Event X, and a situation
where Source A and Source B make contrasting comments about Event X.</rdfs:comment>
