 1: AbbreviatedPronoun : Abbreviation/Syntactic_Type="pronominal" (Romanian), e.g., d-ta/dumneata, d-tale/dumitale, d-voastră/dumneavoastră, dv./dumneavoastră, dvs./dumneavoastră (http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#Pronominal)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 2: BaseForm : 
			Strong inflection is a characteristic of lexemes, not individual tokens.
			In traditional English tagsets, e.g., SUSANNE  or the PennTreeBank tagset, surface ambiguities are normally not resolved.
			Uninflected forms and forms that have the same form (e.g., "be" as an imperative) are tagged as BaseForm. (Ch. Chiarcos)
			
			Since it is impractical (...) to resolve automatically the 
			ambiguity of these six morphological functions, it is a common practice to assign a single value to the base form, 
			or else to assign two values, one for the finite and one for the non-finite functions. Because of this, the tables 
			below show two tagsets: one tagset representing the 6 attribute-values above, and a reduced tagset (`RTags'), which
			resembles most tagsets so far used for the English language in reducing the six values to two.
			http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/morphsyn/node150.html#SECTION00054000000000000000
			
			BaseForm is not a characteristic of lexemes, but specific to certain forms in a complex paradigm.

 1: Accusative : 
			In nominative-accusative languages, accusative case marks certain syntactic functions, usually direct objects. 		
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsAccusativeCase.htm 17.11.06)
		
 2: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.
			(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.60f)
		
 3: MeasureArgument : added in conformance with TIGER
 4: Positive : 
			Value used in a comparison relationship when no comparison is involved.
			(http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1420)
		
			The Positive is the form of an adjective or 
			adverb on which comparative and superlative are formed.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive  17.11.06)
		
 5: PostHodiernalFuture : 
			PostHodiernalFutureTense locates the situation in question after 
			the span that is culturally defined as 'today' (Bybee, Perkins, 
			and Pagliuca 1994: 247).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PostHodiernalFuture)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 7: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 1: Adjectival : In MULTEXT-East a characteristic of attributive pronouns and abbreviated adjectives, e.g., in Ukrainian e.g., абичий/= бозна-чий/= будь-чий/= дечий/= хтозна-чий/= чий-будь/= чий-небудь/= чийсь/=, абичийого/абичий аби до чийого/абичий бозна-чийого/бозна-чий будь-чийого/будь-чий дечийого/дечий хтозна-чийого/хтозна-чий чийого-будь/чий-будь чийого-небудь/чий-небудь чийогось/чийсь, абичийого/абичий бозна-чийого/бозна-чий будь-чийого/будь-чий дечийого/дечий хтозна-чийого/хтозна-чий чийого-будь/чий-будь чийого-небудь/чий-небудь чийогось/чийсь, абичийому/абичий абичиєму/абичий абичиїм/абичий аби на чийому/абичий аби на чиєму/абичий аби на чиїм/абичий бозна на чийому/бозна-чий бозна на чиєму/бозна-чий бозна на чиїм/бозна-чий будь-чийому/будь-чий будь-чиєму/будь-чий будь-чиїм/будь-чий будь на чийому/будь-чий будь на чиєму/будь-чий будь на чиїм/будь-чий дечийому/дечий дечиєму/дечий дечиїм/дечий де на чийому/дечий де на чиєму/дечий, абичийому/абичий абичиєму/абичий бозна-чийому/бозна-чий бозна-чиєму/бозна-чий будь-чийому/будь-чий будь-чиєму/будь-чий дечийому/дечий дечиєму/дечий хтозна-чийому/хтозна-чий хтозна-чиєму/хтозна-чий чийому-будь/чий-будь чиєму-будь/чий-будь чийому-небудь/чий-небудь чиєму-небудь/чий-небудь чийомусь/чийсь чиємусь/чийсь, абичийому/абичий абичиєму/абичий бозна-чийому/бозна-чий будь-чийому/будь-чий будь-чиєму/будь-чий дечийому/дечий хтозна-чийому/хтозна-чий чийому-будь/чий-будь чийому-небудь/чий-небудь чийомусь/чийсь, абичию/абичий бозна-чию/бозна-чий будь-чию/будь-чий дечию/дечий хтозна-чию/хтозна-чий чию-будь/чий-будь чию-небудь/чий-небудь чиюсь/чийсь, абичия/абичий бозна-чия/бозна-чий будь-чия/будь-чий дечия/дечий хтозна-чия/хтозна-чий чия-будь/чий-будь чия-небудь/чий-небудь чиясь/чийсь, абичиє/абичий бозна-чиє/бозна-чий будь-чиє/будь-чий дечиє/дечий хтозна-чиє/хтозна-чий чиє-будь/чий-будь чиє-небудь/чий-небудь чиєсь/чийсь
			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#Adjectival)
		
 2: AdjectivalAdverb : An adjectival adverb is an adverb that is formally identical to an adjective.&lt;br/&gt;		
			MULTEXT-East Adverb/Type="adjectival" (Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian)&lt;br/&gt;
			Bulgarian AdjectivalAdverbs have the same form as adjectives in Gender = neuter, Person = 3, Number = singular. (MTE v4, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AdjectivalAdverb)
 3: AdjectivalModifier : 
			A nominal is modified by an adjective.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#adjectivalModifier)
		
 4: AdjectivalParticle : Particle that serves to form adjective phrases, e.g., Urdu sā (http://purl.org/olia/emille.owl#AdjectivalParticle)
 5: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticComplement)

 15: QuestionPredicate : SQ â ´ Inverted yes/no question, or main clause of a wh-question, following the wh-phrase in SBARQ. 
(Bies et al. 1995)

SQ|That part of an SBARQ that excludes the wh-word or wh-phrase. See Section 5.32.
(Santorini 1991)

The SBARQ label marks wh-questions (i.e., those that contain a gap and therefore require a trace). A further level of structure, SQ, contains the inverted auxiliary (if there is one) and the rest of the sentence. The inverted auxiliary in wh-questions is not labeled. ...

SQ
(See also section 1.2.7.) 
â ¢	inside SBARQ:

As described above, inside wh-questions, SQ holds the subject, inverted auxiliary (if any), main verb phrase, and some adjuncts.
â ¢	yes/no questions: 

SQ is used for yes/no questions (i.e., those with inversion but no wh-movement). ...

â ¢	subject-less yes/no questions: 

In questions where the auxiliary and subject do not appear, the auxiliary is unlabeled and a null subject (NP-SBJ *) is used. ...

Note that questions with overt subjects and auxiliaries that show declarative word order are simply labeled S.

â ¢	Tag questions: 

Tag questions are treated as an adjunction of SQ to S. The resulting structure is labeled SQ, since the whole thing is interrogative in nature. The lower SQ is annotated to show predicate deletion; that is, an appropriate null *?* is inserted.

 17: RelationalAdjective : The Slovene adjective expresses three main ideas: quality (qualitative adjectives, kakovostni pridevniki), relation (relational adjectives, vrstni pridevniki) and possession (possessive adjectives, svojilni pridevniki).
			Relational adjectives express type, class or numerical sequence of a noun. For instance: kemijska in fizikalna sprememba (chemical and physical change), fotografski aparat (photographic device (=camera)). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_grammar)

 14: RelationalAdjective : The Slovene adjective expresses three main ideas: quality (qualitative adjectives, kakovostni pridevniki), relation (relational adjectives, vrstni pridevniki) and possession (possessive adjectives, svojilni pridevniki).
			Relational adjectives express type, class or numerical sequence of a noun. For instance: kemijska in fizikalna sprememba (chemical and physical change), fotografski aparat (photographic device (=camera)). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_grammar)

			adverb which indicates that something has some feature to a greater 
			degree than anything it is being compared to in a given context.

 18: SuperlativeCase : 
			SuperlativeCase expresses that  the referent of the noun it marks is the location onto 
			which another referent is moving. It has the meaning of 'onto'. Unfortunate name clash 
			with 'Superlative' as a property of adjectives.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Superlative)

 1: SyntacticAdjunct : 
			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 1: Adposition : 
      An adposition is a cover term for prepositions, postpositions and 
      circumpositions. It expresses a grammatical and semantic relation 
      to another unit within a clause.

 1: DirectObject : 
		A direct object is a grammatical relation that exhibits a combination of certain 
		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object 
		relations previously established in other languages. This may be done by analyzing 
		correspondence between  translation equivalents (Crystal 1985: 94; Hartmann and 
		Stork 1972: 155; Mish et al. 1990: 358; Comrie 1989: 66; Andrews, Avery 1985: 
		68,120,126; Comrie 1985a: 337).
		(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/directObject)
		
 2: FacultativePrepositionalObject : facultative (i.e. optional) prepositional object, e.g., passivized subject (von-phrase)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: IndirectObject : 
			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of    
			 expressing the semantic role of goal and other similar roles. It is 
			 proposed for languages in    which the role is distinct from the 
			 direct object and the oblique object on the basis of multiple    
			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following: 
				(i) Having a particular case marking, commonly dative 
				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number 
				(iii) Being distinct from oblique relations in that it may be relativized 
			 A noun, pronoun, or    noun phrase indicating the recipient or beneficiary of the action of a verb and its direct object   
			 (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1310)
			 
			 Third argument of a ditransitive verb. Ditransitive recipient (Siewierska 2004:57).
			 (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#R)
		
 4: PrepositionalObject : Prepositional object^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 5: SyntacticObject : 
			In linguistics, the object of a transitive verb is one of its core 
			arguments, which generally represents the target of the verb's action or 
			the undergoer of its effects. In more general terms, an object is a 
			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)
			
			An object, traditionally defined, is either a direct object or an indirect object. 
			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject 
			(Crystal 1985: 211; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 155-156; Mish et al. 1990: 814, Comrie 1989: 66).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/object)
		
 6: TransitiveObject : 
			Second argument of a transitive verb, transitive object (P)

			MULTEXT-East Adverb/Type="adjectival" (Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian)&lt;br/&gt;
			Bulgarian AdjectivalAdverbs have the same form as adjectives in Gender = neuter, Person = 3, Number = singular. (MTE v4, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AdjectivalAdverb)
 2: Adverb : 
		An adverb is a part of speech that serves to modify non-nominal parts of speech, 
		i.e., verbs, adjectives (including numbers), clauses, sentences and other adverbs. 
		Modifiers of nouns are primarily determiners and adjectives. 
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverbs 18.09.06)
	
 3: AdverbPhrase : 
			An adverb phrase may consist of an adverb, or a sequence of words in which an adverb is the head of the phrase.
			Adverb phrases may function as adverbials, as in 41:

			(41)  	[NP Her beautiful white hat NP] [VP was [ADVP very nearly ADVP] ruined VP]
			
			or as modifiers of adjectives, as in 42:
			
			(42)  	[NP Il NP] [VP parle [ADVP infiniment plus couramment ADVP] VP]

			or noun phrases, as in 43:

			(43)  	[NP They NP] [VP let [NP me NP] [VP speak VP] [ADVP now and then ADVP] VP]
			
			or as the complement of a preposition, as in 44:
			
			(44)  	[ADVP Strangely enough ADVP] , [NP we NP] [VP received [NP a reply NP] [NP the next day NP] VP]

			Other examples:

 1: Adverbial : -ADV (adverbial)
— marks a constituent other than ADVP or PP when it is used adverbially (e.g., NPs or free (“headless”) relatives). However, constituents that themselves are modifying an ADVP generally do not get -ADV. 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 2: AdverbialModifier : 
			An adverbial modifier modifies a verb.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#adverbialModifier)
		
 3: AdverbialParticiple : Adverb/Type="participle" is used in the Slovene MTE v4 specs, e.g., 'leže' / lying. Slovenian adverbial participles are, however, not attested for Resian. (MTE v4)(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AdverbialParticiple)
 4: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 5: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: PronominalAdverb : 
			Pronominal adverbs substitute for a preposition (which is incorporated into them) and an NP, cf.
			English therefore lit. "for this (reason, ...)", German deswegen lit. "because of this (reason, ...)".
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/elm_de/node235.html 21.09.06, examples Ch. Chiarcos)
		
 7: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticComplement)

 2: CliticDefiniteArticle : 
			clitic definite determiner, e.g., in Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Romanian (http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#CliticDeterminerType)
		
 3: CliticSpecificArticle : 
			Persian does have an article, but it marks specificity rather than definiteness. The Persian article is similar to the Balkan one (a clitic of pronominal origin that's written together with the word), except that it isn't exactly definite (you can even see it described as an indefinite article).
			(Ivan A. Derzhanski, p.c. 2010/06/18)
		
 4: DefiniteArticle : 
			A definite article is used before singular and plural nouns that refer to a

			Von Heusinger (2002) likes the test in English of inserting ʻcertainʼ after the

 1: AspectMarkingAuxiliary : An auxiliary that marks exclusively aspect, e.g., in Urdu:
		
		Auxiliaries:
		Based on the syntactic nature of Urdu, auxiliaries are divided into two categories. Aspectual
		auxiliaries always occur after main verb of the sentence. Tense auxiliaries are used to show the
		time of the action. They occurred at the end of the verb phrase (Sajjad 2007).
		
		E.g., Urdu rahā, an auxiliary element is used to mark the durative aspect. (Hardie 2004, http://purl.org/olia/emille.owl#RahaAuxiliary)
		
 2: AspectParticle : In the Romanian MULTEXT-East scheme, a verbal particle with Particle/Type="aspect" modifies the verbs and carries information on the verb form, i.e., on its aspect  (Dan Tufis, email 2010/06/09, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AspectParticle)
 3: CessativeAspect : 
                            Aspect that expresses the cessation of an event or state.
                                (SIL; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2001)
                            
 4: CompletiveAspect : To do something thoroughly and to completion.
 5: ContinuousAspect : 
			Similar to progressive, however an aspect is continuous versus progressive 
			when it is anchored to non-punctual time reference (Salaberry 2002:264).

 8: FrequentiveAspect : 
			Events which are frequently repeated, differs from habitual in that it can

			simple whole. 
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsImperfectiveAspect.htm  17.11.06)
			
			The imperfective aspects ... do not view the situation as bounded, 
			but rather as ongoing in either a durative, continuative or habitual 
			sense (Bybee 1985:21)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#imperfectiveAspect)
			
			A viewpoint aspect which encodes the speaker’s lack of attention to the endpoints

			portion of some event (Bybee 1985: 147, 149; Payne 1997: 240; Bhat 1999:176).

 12: InchoativeAspect : Aspect that expresses the beginning of an event or state.
 13: IterativeAspect : 
			IterativeAspect, also called repetitives, encodes a number of events 
			of the same type that are repeated on a particular occasion. The time
			interval which is relevant to the iterative is relatively shorter than 
			in the case of the habitual (Bybee 1985: 150; Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca 
			1994: 127). Portrays events repeated on the same occasion (like the 
			iterative knocking on the door) (Bhat 1999: 53)

		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 14: PerfectiveAspect : 
			The perfective aspects (inceptive, punctual and completive) view 
			the situation as a bounded entity, and often put an emphasis on 
			its beginning or end. (Bybee 1985:21)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#perfectiveAspect)
		
			The Perfective aspect is an aspect that expresses a temporal view 
			of an event or state as a simple whole, apart from the consideration 
			of the internal structure of the time in which it occurs. 
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsPerfectiveAspect.htm  17.11.06)
			
			A viewpoint aspect which encodes the speaker’s willingness to attend to the endpoints 
			of the situation referred to. Perfective aspect is the canonical mode of presentation 
			for events (Michaelis 1998: xv).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Perfective)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 15: PhasalAspect : 
			A set of aspectual distinctions involving relations between a background 
			situation (the reference situation) and a situation located relative to 
			the reference situation (the denoted situation). In English, phasal 
			distinctions are expressed by auxiliary-headed constructions, like the 
			inceptive, progressive, and perfect constructions, whose head verbs express 
			the aspectual class of the denoted situation. The aspectual class of the 
			denoted situation differs from that of the reference situation 
			(Michaelis 1998:xv). 
			An event may have a beginning and an end, a middle portion (continuing or 
			changing), and also an ensuing result or an altered state. These are 
			considered to be the various “phases‽ of an event. A speaker may talk about 
			an event from the point of view of any of these individual phases, and his 
			language may have inflectional (or other type of) markers for representing 
			these distinctions. Since such markers indicate distinctions in the temporal 
			structure of an event, we may regard them as belonging to the category of 
			aspect. It has been suggested (Dik 1989: 186) that these may be grouped 
			under a subcategory (or “level") of aspect called “phasal aspect". 
			(Bhat 1999:49)

 16: PointOfViewAspect : 
			point of view aspect
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#viewPointAspect)
		
 17: ProgressiveAspect : 
			ProgressiveAspect, also called the continuative or the durative, 
			encodes a single event as an ongoing process. Thus, states cannot 
			generally be encoded with the progressive (Comrie 1976: 32-35; 
			Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca 1994: 127-139; Payne 1997: 240). An 
			exponent of phasal aspect which expresses a stative situation that 
			holds during the time at which an event is occurring (e. g., He is 
			fixing the fence) 
			(Michaelis 1998:xv).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Progressive)
		
 18: PurposiveAspect : The purposive aspect appears to add the notion of intention or probability, both negative and positive.
		(Steckley, 2007, p. 14, about Huron)
		
		(John Steckley, 2007, Words of the Huron, Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press)
		
 19: QuantificationalAspect : 
			A speaker may report an event as occurring once only (semelfactive) or 
			several times (iterative); he may view it as a specific event or as part 
			of a general habit of carrying out similar events; he may also differentiate 
			between different degrees of frequency with which the event occurs. The 
			markers that a given language provides for one or more of these meaning 
			distinctions can be grouped under a subcategory called “quantificational 
			aspect", as all of them refer to the quantitative aspect of the event 
			concerned (Bhat 1999:53).

 1: AttributiveAdjective : 
			An attributive adjective is an adjective that qualifies or 
			modifies a noun and that precedes the noun, e.g."a delicious 
			apple", "a short letter".
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective 18.09.06)
		
 2: AttributivePronoun : 
			An attributive pronoun is a pronoun that modifies an NP.
		
 3: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.
			(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.60f)
		
 4: MeasureArgument : added in conformance with TIGER
 5: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 18: DirectCase : 
			In the Romanian case system the value 'direct' conflates 'nominative' and 'accusative', 
			e.g., -acea/acel, -aceasta/acesta, -această/acest
			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#DirectCase)
		
 19: DistributiveCase : 
			The distributive case is used on nouns for the meanings of per or each, e.g., Hungarian egyenként/egy, hetenként/hét, ilyenként/ily, kéthetenként/kéthét, rekordonként/rekord, tömbönként/tömb, vércsoportonként/vércsoport
			
			In Hungarian it is -nként and expresses the manner when something happens to each member of a set one by one (e.g., fejenként "per head", esetenként "in some case"), or the frequency in time (hetenként "once a week", tízpercenként "every ten minutes").
			In the Finnish language, this adverb type is rare, even rarer in the singular. Its ending is -ttain/-ttäin. The basic meaning is "separately for each". For example, maa ("country") becomes maittain for an expression like Laki ratifioidaan maittain ("The law is ratified separately in each country"). It can be used to distribute the action to frequent points in time, e.g., päivä (day) has the plural distributive päivittäin (each day). It can mean also "in (or with) regard to the (cultural) perspective" when combined with a word referring to an inhabitant (-lais-). Frequently Finns (suomalaiset) say that suomalaisittain tuntuu oudolta, että, or "in the Finnish perspective, it feels strange that".

 21: EquativeCase : 
		Case that expresses likeness or identity to the 
		referent of the noun it marks. It can have meaning, 
		such as: 'as', 'like', or 'in the capacity of'. 
		(http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1279)
		@en
 22: ErgativeCase : 
			In ergative-absolutive languages, the ergative case identifies the subject of a transitive verb. 
			In such languages, the ergative case is typically marked (most salient), while the absolutive 
			case is unmarked. (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#ergativeCase 
			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_case).
		
 23: EssiveCase : 
			EssiveCase expresses that  the referent of the noun it marks is the 
			location at which another referent exists (Lyons 1968: 299,301; Gove, 
			et al. 1966: 778; Crystal 1985: 112; Blake 1994: 154-5).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Essive)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 24: EssiveFormalCase : 
			The Hungarian "formativus, or essivus-formalis `-ként' ... usually expresses a position, task and manner of the person or the thing." (Nose 2003), e.g., Hungarian 'katonaként' -&gt; [serves] as a soldier. (Csaba Oravecz, email 2010/06/15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
			
			"Haspelmath &amp; Buchholz (1998:321) explained the function of the essive case as ``role phrases''. Role phrases represent the role of the function in which a participant appears. They regard the role phrases as adverbial."
			(Nose 2003, p. 117)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			In the Hungarian language this case combines the Essive case and the Formal case, and it can express the position, task, state (e.g. "as a tourist"), or the manner (e.g. "like a hunted animal"). The status of the suffix -ként in the declension system is disputed for several reasons. First, in general, Hungarian case suffixes are absolute word-final, while -ként permits further suffixation by the locative suffix -i. Second, most Hungarian case endings participate in vowel harmony, while -ként does not. For these reasons, many modern analyses of the Hungarian case system, starting with László Antal's "A magyar esetrendszer" (1961) do not consider the essive/formal to be a case.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essive-formal_case)&lt;br/&gt;

			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#FactiveCase)
 26: FormalCase : In Hungarian, `essive-formal' is in some descriptions simply called `formal', with the affix _-képp(en)_ and meaning (`in
			the form of ...', they probably meant when they came up with the term).
			In the Hungarian MULTEXT-East scheme, essive-formal and formal are distinguished.

 27: GenitiveCase : 
			Genitive case signals that the referent of the marked noun is the possessor 
			of the referent of another noun, e.g. "the man's foot".  In some languages, 
			genitive case may express an associative relation between the marked noun 
			and another noun.

			The case appears also in Finnish as an adverbial (adverb-forming) case. Used with a cardinal number it denotes the number of actions; for example, viisi (five) -&gt; viidesti (five times). Used with adjectives it refers to the mean of the action, corresponding the English suffix -ly: kaunis (beautiful) -&gt; kauniisti (beautifully). It is also used with a small number of nouns: leikki (play) -&gt; leikisti (just kidding, not really). In addition, it acts as an intensifier when used with a swearword: piru -&gt; pirusti.

			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#partitiveCase 
			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive)
			
			PartitiveCase expresses the partial nature of the referent of the 
			noun it marks, as opposed to expressing the whole unit or class 
			of which the referent is a part. This case may be found in items 
			such as the following: existential clauses, nouns that are 
			accompanied by numerals or units of measure, or predications of 
			material from which something is made. It often has a meaning 
			similar to the English word 'some' (Pei and Gaynor 1954: 161; 
			Richards, Platt, and Weber 1985: 208; Quirk, et al. 1985: 249;

 54: PurposiveCase : Purposive marks the goal of an activity, e.g., 'going out FOR (i.e. to catch) KANGAROOS'; 'call them FOR (i.e. to eat) FOOD'. 
		The common purposive suffix -gu is a recurrent suffix on verbs ... The purposive case suffix is often used on a nominalised clause (and this may possibly be the origin of the verbal purposive).

 1: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.

 2: MeasureArgument : added in conformance with TIGER
 3: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.

 1: Comparative : 
			The comparative is the form of an adjective or adverb which denotes 
			the degree or grade by which a person, thing, or other entity has a 
			property or quality greater or less in extent than that of another. 
			In English the structure of a comparative consists normally of the 
			positive form of the adjective or adverb, plus the suffix -er, or 
			(especially in the case of longer words) the modifier "more" (or 
			"less") before the adjective or adverb. The form is usually completed 
			by "than" and the noun which is being compared, e.g. "he is taller 
			than his father is", or "the village is less picturesque than the 
			town near by is". (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative  17.11.06)
		
 2: ComparativeParticle : 
                            Particle used to compare.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1922)
                            
 3: SubordinatingConjunctionWithComparative : 
			For example, in German the subordinating conjunction "als" is followed 
			by various kinds of comparative clause (including clauses without finite 
			verbs). 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node19.html#oav2u  17.11.06)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: SyntacticAdjunct : 
			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 1: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 2: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

 1: Conjunction : 
		A conjunction is a word that syntactically links words or larger constituents, 
		and expresses a semantic relationship between them.

 2: ConjunctionPhrase : Multi-word conjunction
	
	Besides the usual and, or, but, etc., certain prepositions and subordinating conjunctions can be used as coordinating conjunctions. Multi-word coordinating conjunctions are labeled CONJP (see section 7 [Coordination]). ...
CONJP — Conjunction Phrase. Used to mark certain “multi-word” conjunctions, such as as well as, instead of. 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: CoordinatingConjunction : 
			Coordinating conjunctions, also called coordinators, are conjunctions that 
			join two items of equal syntactic importance.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction 19.09.06)
		
 4: CorrelativeCoordinatingConjunction : 
			When the same word is also placed before the first conjunct, as in French 
			"ou...ou...", the former occurrence is given the Correlative value and the
			latter the Simple value.

			In Romanian, there are three kinds of conjunctions depending on their usage: as such or together with other conjunctions or adverbs: (1) simple, between conjuncts: Ion ori Maria (John or Mary); (2) repetitive, before each conjunct: fie Ion fie Maria fie... (either John or Mary or...) (3) correlative, before a conjoined phrase, it requires specific coordinators between conjuncts: atât mama cât şi tata (both mother and father).

 8: RepetitiveCoordinatingConjunction : Conjunction/Coord_Type="repetit" (Romanian).			
			In Romanian, there are three kinds of conjunctions depending on their usage: as such or together with other conjunctions or adverbs: (1) simple, between conjuncts: Ion ori Maria (John or Mary); (2) repetitive, before each conjunct: fie Ion fie Maria fie... (either John or Mary or...) (3) correlative, before a conjoined phrase, it requires specific coordinators between conjuncts: atât mama cât şi tata (both mother and father). (MTE v4, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#RepetitiveCoordinatingConjunction)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 9: SimpleCoordinatingConjunction : In the Romanian MTE v4 specs, Conjunction/Coord_Type="simple" is defined in contrast to repetitive and correlative coordinating conjunctions.
			In Romanian, there are three kinds of conjunctions depending on their usage: as such or together with other conjunctions or adverbs: (1) simple, between conjuncts: Ion ori Maria (John or Mary); (2) repetitive, before each conjunct: fie Ion fie Maria fie...

			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#SimpleCoordinatingConjunction)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
			Simple applies to the regular type of coordinator occurring between

 10: SubordinatingConjunction : 
			Subordinating conjunctions, also called subordinators, are conjunctions 
			that introduce a dependent clause.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction 19.09.06)
		
 11: SubordinatingConjunctionWithComparative : 
			For example, in German the subordinating conjunction "als" is followed 
			by various kinds of comparative clause (including clauses without finite 
			verbs). 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node19.html#oav2u  17.11.06)

		In Romanian, each conjunction requires another mood, so that the diversity may be controlled by subcategorisation rules. The attribute Sub_Type distinguishes among the positive and negative conjunctions, providing means to control verbal double negation, (as in case of the negative pronouns, determiners and adverbs): nici NU am venit, nimeni NU vorbeşte, nici_un tren N-a trecut, nicăieri N-am văzut (MTE v4, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#NegativeSubordinatingConjunction)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string

 1: DativeCase :

			nouns having the role of a recipient (as of things given), 
			a beneficiary of an action, or a possessor of an item.

 2: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.
			(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.60f)

 4: Positive : 
			Value used in a comparison relationship when no comparison is involved.

 7: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 1: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 2: Clause : 
			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S] 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node31.html)
		
			Clause is the class of constructions that form minimal sentential units. 
			They must include a predicate, all arguments of the predicate, and all 
			modifiers of the predicate and the arguments.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Clause)
		
 3: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

			Conditional clauses refer to a hypothetical situation, in English they are introduced by 
			'if' or 'unless'.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#conditionalClause)
		
 5: CoordinateClause : 
			A coordinate clause is a clause belonging to a series of two or more clauses which are not 
			syntactically dependent on one another, and are joined by means of a coordinate conjunction, 
			a connective or parataxis.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsACoordinateClause.htm).

 12: FiniteClause : 
 13: MainClause : 
			MainClause is the class of clauses that can stand on their own as a full, independent sentence. 
			If a sentence contains any embedded clauses, the main clause is understood as the matrix plus 
			the embedded clauses. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 'John thinks that Mary 
			is sick' is the main clause [Crystal 2001, 231].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/MainClause)

			The independent clause can stand by itself as a grammatically viable simple sentence. Multiple 
			independent clauses can be joined (usually with a comma and a coordinating conjunction) to form 
			a compound sentence (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#mainClause 
			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause).
		
 14: ReducedRelativeClause : RRC (reduced relative clause)
Reduced relative clauses are adjoined to the NP they modify. 
(Bies et al. 1995)

We will use the term \reduced relative clause" to refer to participial or adjectival constituents of the
type illustrated in (@26).

(26) He bought two watches designed by Paloma Picasso.

Reduced relative clauses should be bracketed as adjunction structures. The structure of ( 26) is thus as in
(@27). Note that the reduced relative clause, which is headed by a participle, is bracketed as a VP.

(27)
(S (NP He)
(VP bought
(NP (NP two watches)
(VP designed
(PP by
(PNP (PNP Paloma)
(PNP Picasso))))))
.)
(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 15: RelativeClause : 
			A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun. For example, the noun phrase 
			[the man who wasn't there] contains the noun [man], which is modified by the relative clause 
			[who wasn't there]
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#relativeClause with reference 
			to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause and Dik 1997)
			
			There are three di erent types of relative clauses in English (be careful not to confuse relative clauses
			and complement clauses):
			(i) wh-relative clauses (a guy who(m) I know),
			(ii) that-relative clauses (a guy that I know), and
			(iii) zero relative clauses (a guy I know).
			(Santorini 1991)
		
 16: SubordinateClause : 
			SubordinateClause is the class of clauses that cannot stand on their 
			own as sentences. A matrix clause combined with a subordinate clause 
			form a main clause. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 
			'Mary is sick' is the subordinate clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SubordinateClause)

			Dependent clauses (which are also sometimes referred to as subordinate 
			clauses) cannot stand alone as sentences. They usually begin with 
			subordinating conjunctions. A sentence with an independent clause and 
			any number of dependent clauses is referred to as a complex sentence. 
			One with two or more independent clauses and any number of dependent 
			clauses is referred to as a compound-complex sentence 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause, cf. 
			http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#subordinateClause).

			A subordinate clause is an embedded construction which contains a finite verb form. 			
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#finiteEmbeddedConstruction)
		
 17: SubordinatingConjunctionWithFiniteClause : 
			For example, in German the subordinating conjunction "weil" introduces 
			a clause with a finite verb.

 1: DegreeAdverb : 
			Any adverb which modifies an adjective, an adverb, a verbal particle, a preposition, 
			a conjunction or a determiner is a degree adverb. 
			(http://xlex.uni-muenster.de/Portal/MTPE/tagsetDescriptionEN.doc, p. 113, 8.1 Degree Adverbs 23.09.06)
			
			Also known as specifier adverb (http://www.unlweb.net/unlarium/dictionary/export_tagset.php)
		
 2: ElativeDegree : e.g., прешпионска/шпионски, прешпионскава/шпионски, прешпионскана/шпионски, прешпионската/шпионски, прешпионски/шпионски, прешпионскиве/шпионски, прешпионскине/шпионски, прешпионскиов/шпионски, прешпионскион/шпионски (mk)e.g., predivan, prekasan, premanjeg/premali, premanjega/premali, premanjem/premali, premanjemu/premali, premanji/premali (sr)MULTEXT-East Degree="elative" (Adjective: Resian, Serbian, Macedonian)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			In Semitic languages, ElativeDegree refers to the “adjective of superiority.” In some languages such as Arabic, the concepts of comparative and superlative degree of an adjective are merged into a single form, the elative. How this form is understood or translated depends upon context and definiteness. In the absence of comparison, the elative conveys the notion of “greatest”, “supreme.” The elative of كبير (kabí:r, "big") is أكبر (’ákbar, “bigger/biggest”, “greater/greatest”). (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/elative)
			
			In Slavic languages, as well, it is pretty standard. I do agree with the definition though, that "the elative conveys the notion of “greatest”, “supreme.”" So, Slovene "lep" is beautiful, "prelep" is very (or supremely) beautiful; I guess the "pre-" prefix could be roughly translated as "over-". Used in Resian, Serbian, Macedonian. In Slovenian, we banished it, as even "ordinary" degrees are borderline inflection / derivation, but, I think, elative is is definitely not inflection.

 1: CliticDefiniteArticle : 
			clitic definite determiner, e.g., in Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Romanian (http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#CliticDeterminerType)
		
 2: CliticSpecificArticle : 
			Persian does have an article, but it marks specificity rather than definiteness. The Persian article is similar to the Balkan one (a clitic of pronominal origin that's written together with the word), except that it isn't exactly definite (you can even see it described as an indefinite article).
			(Ivan A. Derzhanski, p.c. 2010/06/18)
		
 3: DemonstrativeDeterminer : 
			Demonstratives are deictic expressions (they depend on an external frame of reference) 
			which indicate  entities a speaker refers to, and distinguishes those entities from 
			others. Demonstratives are usually employed for spatial deixis (using the context of 
			the physical surroundings), but in many languages they double as discourse deictics, 
			referring not to concrete objects but to words, phrases and propositions mentioned in 
			speech.
            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative 19.09.06)
		
 4: Determiner : 
			A determiner is a noun modifier that expresses the reference of a noun or noun phrase 
			in the context, including quantity, rather than attributes expressed by adjectives. 
			This part of speech is defined in some languages, such as in English, as it is distinct 
			from adjectives grammatically, though most English dictionaries still identify the 
			determiners as adjectives. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner 19.09.06)
		
 5: DeterminerPhrase : 
		Certain pronouns serving as determiners in noun phrases may be premodified, for instance, 
		by degree adverbs such as in German "so viele ¨Altere", "gar kein Schutz", etc.
		In the case of "so viele Ältere", the premodifying adverb so is attached to the indefinite
		pronoun viele. Together, they form a determiner phrase (DP), which is attached to the
		head noun Ältere on the same level: [so viele] Ältere
		(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.63)
		
 6: EmphaticDeterminer : Determiner/Type="emphatic" (Romanian)&lt;br/&gt;
				
				In Romanian, there are specific forms for the so-called emphatic determiner, which may accompany both a noun and a personal pronoun: fata însăşi (the girl herself), also ea însăşi (she herself). e.g., 
			însele/însumi, însemi/însumi, însene/însumi, însevă/însumi, înseşi/însumi, înseţi/însumi, însumi, însuşi/însumi, însuţi/însumi 
			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#EmphaticDeterminer)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 7: ExclamatoryDeterminer : 
			A exclamatory determiner is used in combination with a Nominal Phrase in order to create 
			an exclamation (a more emphatic form of statement), e.g. "What a lovely colour!", "What a wonderful day this is!"
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/pub/eagles/lexicons/elm_en.ps.gz, p.27, 07.05.07;
			 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics), 07.05.07)
		
 8: HeadOfNP : 
			The HeadFunction is a function of an adjective or participle that can serve as the focus of the phrase.
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 9: IndefiniteDeterminer : 
			An indefinite determiner is a determiner that expresses a referent's  
			indefinite number or amount, i.e. "some", "any", "many". 
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAQuantifier.htm 22.09.06)
			
			Note that here, a separate top-level class Quantifier has been introduced that
			covers expressions of number and amount as *semantic* concepts. Plural indefinite
			determiners are thus to be modeled as IndefiniteDeteriner and Quantifier.
		
 10: InterrogativeDeterminer : 
			A interrogative is a function word used to introduce an interrogative clause.
			E.g. "which", "what", "whose" (interrogative possessive determiner) are  
			interrogative determiner in English. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word  02.05.07)
		
 11: NegativeDeterminer : Determiner/Type="negative" (Romanian)&lt;br/&gt;			
			In Romanian the negative determiner is expressed by the unit nici + indefinite article (e.g. nici un, nici o). (MTE v4)
			e.g., nici-o/nici_un, nici_o/nici_un, nici_un, nici_unei/nici_un, nici_unii/nici_un, nici_unor/nici_un, nici_unui/nici_un 
			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#NegativeDeterminer)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 12: NonspecificArticle : 
			"By ʻspecificʼ and ʻnon-specificʼ I intend the difference between the
			two readings of English indefinites like (3):
			
			(3) Iʼm looking for a deer.
			
			In the specific reading there is a particular deer, say Bambi, that I am
			looking for. In the non-specific reading I will be happy to find any deer.
			Von Heusinger (2002) likes the test in English of inserting ʻcertainʼ after the
			ʻaʼ to fix the specific reading. In either reading of (3) a deer is being
			introduced as a new discourse referent. This is opposed to ʻdefiniteʼ which
			requires a previous pragmatic instantiation as in ʻIʼm looking for the deer.ʼ
			In English both the readings of (3) are indefinite. In Klallam, the specific
			demonstratives are neither definite nor indefinite."
			(Montler, Timothy. 2007. Klallam demonstratives. Papers ICSNL XLVII. The 42nd International Conference on Salish and Neighbouring Language, pp. 409-425. University of British Columbia Working Papers in Linguistics, Volume 20; on specific vs. nonspecific determiners in Klallam, a Salish language, http://montler.net/papers/KlallamDemons.pdf)
		
 13: PartitiveDeterminer : 
			A partitive determiner indicates an indefinite quantity of a mass noun; 
			there is no partitive article in English, though the words some or any 
			often have that function.
			(Wilson and Leech 1996)
		
 14: PossessiveDeterminer : 
			A possessive determiner is a part of speech that modifies a noun 
			by attributing ownership to someone or something.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_adjective 19.09.06)
		
 15: PronounOrDeterminer : 
		The parts of speech Pronoun, Determiner and Article heavily overlap in their formal and functional 
		characteristics, and different analyses for different languages entail separating them out in 
		different ways.
		In Eagles, Pronouns and Determiners are placed in one `super-category'. For some descriptions it may 
		be thought best to treat them as totally different parts of speech.
		(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node17.html#recp 19.09.06)
	
 16: ReflexiveDeterminer : 
                            Determiner that refers to the same entity.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1377)
                            
 17: ReflexivePossessiveDeterminer : Attributive possessive pronoun form of the reflexive pronoun, e.g., Russian свой:
		
		Обама на свой день рождения угощал гостей стейками и хот-догами.
		Obama on his day of.birth entertained guests with.steaks and hot.dogs
		"On his birthday, Obama entertained his guests with steaks and hot dogs." (http://ua.rian.ru/world_news/20110805/78815136.html)
		
		The antecedent of a possessive reflexive is not determined by its gender, but by its syntactic prominence.
		
 18: RelativeDeterminer : 
			The relative determiner describes a attributive relative pronoun. In German  
			"wessen" in "Ich weiss nicht, wessen Auto das ist." or  the English  "whose" 
			in "The man whose daughter became ill.".
			The relative determiner needs a noun to complete a NP (Nominal Phrase).
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/pub/eagles/lexicons/elm_en.ps.gz, p.28, 07.05.07)
		
 19: SpecificArticle : 
			"By ʻspecificʼ and ʻnon-specificʼ I intend the difference between the
			two readings of English indefinites like (3):
			
			(3) Iʼm looking for a deer.
			
			In the specific reading there is a particular deer, say Bambi, that I am
			looking for. In the non-specific reading I will be happy to find any deer.
			Von Heusinger (2002) likes the test in English of inserting ʻcertainʼ after the

			In English both the readings of (3) are indefinite. In Klallam, the specific
			demonstratives are neither definite nor indefinite."

 20: UniquitiveDeterminer : Determiner/Type="exceptional" is applied to the Persian uniquitive determiner تنها  i.e., "the only" (MTE v4; Hamidreza Kobdani, email 2010/06/15, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#UniquitiveDeterminer)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string

 2: FusedPrepArt : 
			The additional value Fused prep-art is for the benefit of those who do not find it 
			practical to split fused words such as French au (= à + le) into two text words. 
			This very common phenomenon of a fused preposition + article in West European 
			languages should preferably, however, be handled by assigning two tags to the 
			same orthographic word (one for the preposition and one for the article).

 1: DirectObject : 
		A direct object is a grammatical relation that exhibits a combination of certain 
		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object 
		relations previously established in other languages. This may be done by analyzing 
		correspondence between  translation equivalents (Crystal 1985: 94; Hartmann and 
		Stork 1972: 155; Mish et al. 1990: 358; Comrie 1989: 66; Andrews, Avery 1985: 
		68,120,126; Comrie 1985a: 337).
		(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/directObject)
		
 2: FacultativePrepositionalObject : facultative (i.e. optional) prepositional object, e.g., passivized subject (von-phrase)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: GenitiveAttribute : added in conformance to the TIGER scheme
 4: GenitiveCase : 
			Genitive case signals that the referent of the marked noun is the possessor 
			of the referent of another noun, e.g. "the man's foot".  In some languages, 
			genitive case may express an associative relation between the marked noun 
			and another noun. 
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsGenitiveCase.htm 17.11.06)
		
 5: IndirectObject : 
			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of    
			 expressing the semantic role of goal and other similar roles. It is 
			 proposed for languages in    which the role is distinct from the 
			 direct object and the oblique object on the basis of multiple    
			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following: 
				(i) Having a particular case marking, commonly dative 
				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number 
				(iii) Being distinct from oblique relations in that it may be relativized 
			 A noun, pronoun, or    noun phrase indicating the recipient or beneficiary of the action of a verb and its direct object   
			 (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1310)
			 
			 Third argument of a ditransitive verb. Ditransitive recipient (Siewierska 2004:57).

 6: PrepositionalObject : Prepositional object^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 7: SyntacticObject : 
			In linguistics, the object of a transitive verb is one of its core 
			arguments, which generally represents the target of the verb's action or 
			the undergoer of its effects. In more general terms, an object is a 
			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)
			
			An object, traditionally defined, is either a direct object or an indirect object. 
			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject 
			(Crystal 1985: 211; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 155-156; Mish et al. 1990: 814, Comrie 1989: 66).

 1: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.

 5: Positive : 
			Value used in a comparison relationship when no comparison is involved.
			(http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1420)
		
			The Positive is the form of an adjective or 
			adverb on which comparative and superlative are formed.

 6: PostHodiernalFuture : 
			PostHodiernalFutureTense locates the situation in question after 
			the span that is culturally defined as 'today' (Bybee, Perkins, 
			and Pagliuca 1994: 247).

 7: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.

			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 8: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 2: GenitiveCase : 
			Genitive case signals that the referent of the marked noun is the possessor 
			of the referent of another noun, e.g. "the man's foot".  In some languages, 
			genitive case may express an associative relation between the marked noun 
			and another noun.

	 A gerund is a kind of verbal noun that exists in some languages. In today's English, 
	 gerunds are nouns built from a verb with an '-ing' suffix. They can be used as the 
	 subject of a sentence, an object, or an object of preposition. They can also be used

	 the same root but the gerund and the common noun have different shades of meaning.
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/English:Gerund 19.09.06)

	The term _gerund_ is ambiguous: with respect  to Latin, in whose grammatical tradition it originates, it refers to a  deverbal noun, and is needed in this function for Polish as well; in  descriptions of some other languages, however, it has been used for an  adverbial participle.  
	The two meanings have nothing in common, except  that the English _ing_-form can translate both. (Ivan A Derzhanski, email 2010/06/09)

 2: ImpersonalPronoun : 
                            Pronoun lacking person referent.
                                (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1426)
								
							More precisely, a form of pronoun that denotes the absence of a concrete or specific referent, e.g., German "man".
							As opposed to IndefinitePronoun, this referent is not just discourse-new, but generic or hypothetical.
                            
 3: ImpersonalVerb : 
                            (of a verb) having no logical subject. Usually in English the pronoun it is used in such cases as a grammatical subject, as for example in It is raining. (of a pronoun) not denoting a person

 1: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 2: Clause : 
			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S] 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node31.html)
		
			Clause is the class of constructions that form minimal sentential units. 
			They must include a predicate, all arguments of the predicate, and all 
			modifiers of the predicate and the arguments.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Clause)
		
 3: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: ConditionalClause : 
			Conditional clauses refer to a hypothetical situation, in English they are introduced by 
			'if' or 'unless'.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#conditionalClause)
		
 5: CoordinateClause : 
			A coordinate clause is a clause belonging to a series of two or more clauses which are not 
			syntactically dependent on one another, and are joined by means of a coordinate conjunction, 
			a connective or parataxis.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsACoordinateClause.htm).
		
 6: CosubordinateClause : 
 7: EmbeddedInfinitive : 
			An infinitive is the head of the embedded construction. (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withInfinitiveAsHead)
			
			Infinitival relatives. See section 14 [Infinitives] for more information.

	(Bies et al. 1995)
		
 8: FiniteClause : 
 9: Infinitive : 
		An infinitive is the base form of a verb. 
		It is unmarked for inflectional categories such as the following: Aspect,  Modality, Number, Person and Tense.
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInfinitive.htm 19.09.06)
	
 10: InfinitiveParticle : 
                            Particle used to express infinitive.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1896)
                            
 11: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.
			
			(Akshar Bharati, Dipti Misra Sharma, Lakshmi Bai, Rajeev Sangal (2006), AnnCorra : Annotating Corpora. Guidelines For POS And Chunk Annotation For Indian Languages, Tech. Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
 12: MainClause : 
			MainClause is the class of clauses that can stand on their own as a full, independent sentence. 
			If a sentence contains any embedded clauses, the main clause is understood as the matrix plus 
			the embedded clauses. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 'John thinks that Mary 
			is sick' is the main clause [Crystal 2001, 231].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/MainClause)

 14: RelativeClause : 
			A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun. For example, the noun phrase 
			[the man who wasn't there] contains the noun [man], which is modified by the relative clause 
			[who wasn't there]
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#relativeClause with reference 
			to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause and Dik 1997)
			
			There are three di erent types of relative clauses in English (be careful not to confuse relative clauses
			and complement clauses):
			(i) wh-relative clauses (a guy who(m) I know),
			(ii) that-relative clauses (a guy that I know), and
			(iii) zero relative clauses (a guy I know).
			(Santorini 1991)
		
 15: SubordinateClause : 
			SubordinateClause is the class of clauses that cannot stand on their 
			own as sentences. A matrix clause combined with a subordinate clause 
			form a main clause. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 
			'Mary is sick' is the subordinate clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SubordinateClause)

			Dependent clauses (which are also sometimes referred to as subordinate 
			clauses) cannot stand alone as sentences. They usually begin with 
			subordinating conjunctions. A sentence with an independent clause and 
			any number of dependent clauses is referred to as a complex sentence. 
			One with two or more independent clauses and any number of dependent 
			clauses is referred to as a compound-complex sentence 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause, cf. 
			http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#subordinateClause).

			A subordinate clause is an embedded construction which contains a finite verb form. 			
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#finiteEmbeddedConstruction)
		
 16: SubordinatingConjunctionWithFiniteClause : 
			For example, in German the subordinating conjunction "weil" introduces 
			a clause with a finite verb.

 4: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 1: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 2: Clause : 
			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S] 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node31.html)
		
			Clause is the class of constructions that form minimal sentential units. 
			They must include a predicate, all arguments of the predicate, and all 
			modifiers of the predicate and the arguments.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Clause)
		
 3: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

 1: EmbeddedInfinitive : 
			An infinitive is the head of the embedded construction. (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withInfinitiveAsHead)
			
			Infinitival relatives. See section 14 [Infinitives] for more information.

 2: Infinitive : 
		An infinitive is the base form of a verb. 
		It is unmarked for inflectional categories such as the following: Aspect,  Modality, Number, Person and Tense.
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInfinitive.htm 19.09.06)

 4: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 6: Intransitive : 
			A predicate/verb that takes one argument, e.g., English "to go", cf. van Valin and Lapolla (1997).
		
 7: IntransitiveSubject : 
			Intransitive argument (S), single argument of an intransitive verb or 
			only argument in a one-place predicate (frame).

 8: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to:

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

	(Bies et al. 1995)
		
 2: Infinitive : 
		An infinitive is the base form of a verb. 
		It is unmarked for inflectional categories such as the following: Aspect,  Modality, Number, Person and Tense.

 4: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 1: AdnominalConstituent : 
			Adnominal wird jedes Element in einer Konstruktion bezeichnet, das der 
			Modifizierung eines Nomens dient, d.h. alle Formen von Attributen wie 
			Adjektive, Genitivattribute, PrÃ¤positionalattribute, RelativsÃ¤tze. Zum 
			Beispiel, das schÃ¶ne Haus; das Haus des Nachbars; das Haus am See; das 
			Haus, das ich mir schon immer gewÃ¼nscht habe. 
			(http://www.uni-trier.de/uni/fb2/ldv/ldv_wiki/index.php/Adnominal)
		@de
			Each element in a construction is called adnominal that modifies a 
			nominal, such as, all types of attributives, such as adjectives, possessives,
			prepositional attributes and relative clauses, such as the beautiful 
			house; the neighbour’s house, the house at the sea, the house, that I want.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#nominalModifier)
		@en
 2: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

 5: Nominal : -NOM (nominal)
— marks free (“headless”) relatives and gerunds when they act nominally. (See section 9 [WH-Phrases] for more information about free relatives, and section 13 [Gerunds and Participles] for more information about gerunds.) 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: NominalNumber : Nominal numbers are used to identify or refer the things. It does not show the quantity or rank.
			
			Example:
			ངེ་གི་ འགལ་འཕིན་ ཨང་གངས་ འདི་ ༡༧༦༤༩༠༣༧ ཨིན།
			NGIGI DRUELTHRIN ANGDRANG 'DI 17649037 INN

 7: NominalPredicate : 
			A nominal predicate (noun or adjective), either with or without copula. 
			The term nominal predicate may be used for the complements of further 
			copulative verbs (cf. small clauses), e.g. "consider", "call", etc.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.5)
		
 8: NominalQuantifier : A noun which quantifies one or more things, regardless of subject and an object.
			
			ང་གིས་ བམོ་ ལ་ དང་ ཕད་ཅི།

 9: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string

 11: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

 6: DebitiveMood : Mood to express necessity or requirement
 7: DeclarativeMood : 
			Pertaining to the mood or mode of a verb form or clause such that it 
			predicates a type of (formal) assertion (OED).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#declarativeModality)

 14: PresumptiveMood : The presumptive mood is used in Romanian to express presupposition or hypothesis regarding the fact denoted by the verb, as well as other more or less similar attitudes: doubt, curiosity, concern, condition, indifference, inevitability. For example, acolo s-o fi dus "he might have gone there" shows the basic presupposition use, while the following excerpt from a poem by Eminescu shows the use both in a conditional clause de-o fi "suppose it is" and in a main clause showing an attitude of submission to fate le-om duce "we would bear".
			
			De-o fi una, de-o fi alta... Ce e scris și pentru noi,
			Bucuroși le-om duce toate, de e pace, de-i război.

 1: Negation : denotes the negation or the absence (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1839)
		http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#Negated: Negative="yes" encodes negative verbal word-forms in Slavic languages and Estonian. (MTE v4) 
    	In Slovak, for example, verbs form negative by prefix 'ne-', with the exception of the verb "byť" (E. "to be") which forms the negative in indicative by using separate particle "nie", e.g. "nie je" (is not). Here, Slovak "je" would be marked as negative, despite having positive form. In Resian, negative is always marked as 'n' except for two verbs: 'nïman' / not to have, 'nïsi' / not to be. (MTE v4)
 2: NegativeAdverb : Adverb/Type="negative" are used in the Serbian and Romanian MTE v4 specs, e.g., for Romanian nicăieri - nowhere, niciodată - never. (MTE v4)
		(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#NegativeAdverb)
 3: NegativeDeterminer : Determiner/Type="negative" (Romanian)&lt;br/&gt;			
			In Romanian the negative determiner is expressed by the unit nici + indefinite article (e.g. nici un, nici o). (MTE v4)

 1: AdnominalConstituent : 
			Adnominal wird jedes Element in einer Konstruktion bezeichnet, das der 
			Modifizierung eines Nomens dient, d.h. alle Formen von Attributen wie 
			Adjektive, Genitivattribute, PrÃ¤positionalattribute, RelativsÃ¤tze. Zum 
			Beispiel, das schÃ¶ne Haus; das Haus des Nachbars; das Haus am See; das 
			Haus, das ich mir schon immer gewÃ¼nscht habe. 
			(http://www.uni-trier.de/uni/fb2/ldv/ldv_wiki/index.php/Adnominal)
		@de
			Each element in a construction is called adnominal that modifies a 
			nominal, such as, all types of attributives, such as adjectives, possessives,
			prepositional attributes and relative clauses, such as the beautiful 
			house; the neighbour’s house, the house at the sea, the house, that I want.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#nominalModifier)
		@en
 2: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: Nominal : -NOM (nominal)
— marks free (“headless”) relatives and gerunds when they act nominally. (See section 9 [WH-Phrases] for more information about free relatives, and section 13 [Gerunds and Participles] for more information about gerunds.) 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: NominalNumber : Nominal numbers are used to identify or refer the things. It does not show the quantity or rank.

 5: NominalPredicate : 
			A nominal predicate (noun or adjective), either with or without copula. 
			The term nominal predicate may be used for the complements of further 
			copulative verbs (cf. small clauses), e.g. "consider", "call", etc.

 7: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 8: PreNominalModifier : 
			Premodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify a following noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 9: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

 11: Noun : 
	A noun, or noun substantive, is a part of speech (a word or phrase) which can co-occur with 
	(in)definite articles and attributive adjectives, and function as the head of a noun phrase.

	The word "noun" derives from the Latin 'nomen' meaning "name", and a traditional definition 
	of nouns is that they are all and only those expressions that refer to a person, place, 
	thing, event, substance, quality, idea or an appointment. They serve as the subject or object 
	of a verb, and the object of a preposition.
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 12: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 13: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)
		
			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.

 14: OnceNoun : noun conveying the meaning that the action is performed once

 18: SpatiotemporalNoun : 
			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."
		(Akshar Bharati, Dipti Misra Sharma, Lakshmi Bai, Rajeev Sangal (2006), AnnCorra : Annotating Corpora. Guidelines For POS And Chunk Annotation For Indian Languages, Tech. Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)
			(IIIT (2007), A Part of Speech Tagger for Indian Languages (POS tagger), Tagset developed at IIIT - Hyderabad after consultations with several institutions through two workshops. available under http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf)
		
 19: TimeNoun : noun expressing time
 20: TitleNoun : A title designates the function or the social status of an individual. Often, it accompanies a proper noun, but it can also be used in place of a proper noun (if the bearer of the title is contextually unambiguous).
			E.g. "The/Det German/Adj Chancellor/Title Angela/Name Merkel/Name said ..." can be used besides "the German Chancellor said ...".
			Accordingly, some schemes (e.g., Chungku et al. 2010, for Dzongkha) group titles together with proper names (http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#ParticularPersonNoun).
			
			However, if multiple people hold the same title, they can be referred to as a group, e.g., "Since WWII, the politics of the German chancellors always followed ...", and in this usage, 
			titles are more comparable to common nouns.
			Functionally, titles are thus an intermediate category between CommonNoun and ProperNoun (cf. also Mulkern 1996).
			
			Titles do, however, share important characteristics with common nouns. 
			In English, for example, titles generally require a definite determiner (unlike proper nouns), even if unambiguous ("the pope"). 
			They are thus classified here as a subtype of CommonNoun.
			
			(Ann E. Mulkern. The name of the game. In Jeanette Gundel and Thorstein Fretheim, editors. Reference and Referent Accessibility: Pragmatics
			and Beyond. John Benjamins, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, 1996, pages 235–250.)  		
		
 21: UnitNoun : Measuring units are frequently used with numerals. However, they have a different syntactic structure than
			numerals (Sajjad 2007). 
			
			In European languages, Units are generally expressed as nouns, e.g., English "ten/Numeral kilogram/Unit".
			"Kilogram" can also be used as a common noun: "The kilogram is losing weight" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12276822)

 22: VerbalNoun : A verbal noun is a noun formed directly as an inflexion of a verb or a verb stem, sharing at least in part its constructions. 
	 This term is applied especially to gerunds, and sometimes also to infinitives and supines.
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_noun 19.09.06)

 24: WHNounPhrase : WHNP|Wh-noun phrase. Noun phrase containing (among other things) a wh-determiner, as in which
book or whose daughter, or consisting of a wh-pronoun like who.
(Santorini 1991)

WHNP
â ´ Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, none of which, or how many leopards.

 12: Noun : 
	A noun, or noun substantive, is a part of speech (a word or phrase) which can co-occur with 
	(in)definite articles and attributive adjectives, and function as the head of a noun phrase.

	The word "noun" derives from the Latin 'nomen' meaning "name", and a traditional definition 
	of nouns is that they are all and only those expressions that refer to a person, place, 
	thing, event, substance, quality, idea or an appointment. They serve as the subject or object 
	of a verb, and the object of a preposition.
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 13: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 14: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'

 19: SpatiotemporalNoun : 
			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."
		(Akshar Bharati, Dipti Misra Sharma, Lakshmi Bai, Rajeev Sangal (2006), AnnCorra : Annotating Corpora. Guidelines For POS And Chunk Annotation For Indian Languages, Tech. Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)
			(IIIT (2007), A Part of Speech Tagger for Indian Languages (POS tagger), Tagset developed at IIIT - Hyderabad after consultations with several institutions through two workshops. available under http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf)
		
 20: TimeNoun : noun expressing time
 21: TitleNoun : A title designates the function or the social status of an individual. Often, it accompanies a proper noun, but it can also be used in place of a proper noun (if the bearer of the title is contextually unambiguous).
			E.g. "The/Det German/Adj Chancellor/Title Angela/Name Merkel/Name said ..." can be used besides "the German Chancellor said ...".
			Accordingly, some schemes (e.g., Chungku et al. 2010, for Dzongkha) group titles together with proper names (http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#ParticularPersonNoun).
			
			However, if multiple people hold the same title, they can be referred to as a group, e.g., "Since WWII, the politics of the German chancellors always followed ...", and in this usage, 
			titles are more comparable to common nouns.
			Functionally, titles are thus an intermediate category between CommonNoun and ProperNoun (cf. also Mulkern 1996).
			
			Titles do, however, share important characteristics with common nouns. 
			In English, for example, titles generally require a definite determiner (unlike proper nouns), even if unambiguous ("the pope"). 
			They are thus classified here as a subtype of CommonNoun.

			and Beyond. John Benjamins, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, 1996, pages 235–250.)  		
		
 22: UnitNoun : Measuring units are frequently used with numerals. However, they have a different syntactic structure than
			numerals (Sajjad 2007). 
			
			In European languages, Units are generally expressed as nouns, e.g., English "ten/Numeral kilogram/Unit".
			"Kilogram" can also be used as a common noun: "The kilogram is losing weight" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12276822)

 23: VerbalNoun : A verbal noun is a noun formed directly as an inflexion of a verb or a verb stem, sharing at least in part its constructions. 
	 This term is applied especially to gerunds, and sometimes also to infinitives and supines.

 25: WHNounPhrase : WHNP|Wh-noun phrase. Noun phrase containing (among other things) a wh-determiner, as in which
book or whose daughter, or consisting of a wh-pronoun like who.
(Santorini 1991)

WHNP
â ´ Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, none of which, or how many leopards.

			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."

Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)
			(IIIT (2007), A Part of Speech Tagger for Indian Languages (POS tagger), Tagset developed at IIIT - Hyderabad after consultations with several institutions through two workshops. available under http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf)
		
 20: TimeNoun : noun expressing time
 21: TitleNoun : A title designates the function or the social status of an individual. Often, it accompanies a proper noun, but it can also be used in place of a proper noun (if the bearer of the title is contextually unambiguous).
			E.g. "The/Det German/Adj Chancellor/Title Angela/Name Merkel/Name said ..." can be used besides "the German Chancellor said ...".
			Accordingly, some schemes (e.g., Chungku et al. 2010, for Dzongkha) group titles together with proper names (http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#ParticularPersonNoun).
			
			However, if multiple people hold the same title, they can be referred to as a group, e.g., "Since WWII, the politics of the German chancellors always followed ...", and in this usage, 
			titles are more comparable to common nouns.
			Functionally, titles are thus an intermediate category between CommonNoun and ProperNoun (cf. also Mulkern 1996).
			
			Titles do, however, share important characteristics with common nouns. 
			In English, for example, titles generally require a definite determiner (unlike proper nouns), even if unambiguous ("the pope"). 
			They are thus classified here as a subtype of CommonNoun.
			
			(Ann E. Mulkern. The name of the game. In Jeanette Gundel and Thorstein Fretheim, editors. Reference and Referent Accessibility: Pragmatics
			and Beyond. John Benjamins, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, 1996, pages 235–250.)  		
		
 22: UnitNoun : Measuring units are frequently used with numerals. However, they have a different syntactic structure than
			numerals (Sajjad 2007). 
			
			In European languages, Units are generally expressed as nouns, e.g., English "ten/Numeral kilogram/Unit".
			"Kilogram" can also be used as a common noun: "The kilogram is losing weight" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12276822)

 23: VerbalNoun : A verbal noun is a noun formed directly as an inflexion of a verb or a verb stem, sharing at least in part its constructions. 
	 This term is applied especially to gerunds, and sometimes also to infinitives and supines.
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_noun 19.09.06)

 25: WHNounPhrase : WHNP|Wh-noun phrase. Noun phrase containing (among other things) a wh-determiner, as in which
book or whose daughter, or consisting of a wh-pronoun like who.
(Santorini 1991)

WHNP
â ´ Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, none of which, or how many leopards.

 1: CommonNoun : 
		A common noun is a noun that signifies a non-specific member of a group.
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsACommonNoun.htm 19.09.06)
	
 2: CountableNoun : 
		A countable noun (also count noun) is a noun which can be modified by a numeral 
		and occur in both singular and plural form, as well as co-occurring with 
		quantificational determiners like every, each, several, most, etc..
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_noun 19.09.06)
	
 3: DiminutiveNoun : 
                            diminutive noun

 4: ElativeNoun : noun to express both comparative and superlative
 5: HonorificCommonNoun : Dzongkha uses honorific forms: ན་བཟའ་/nam za/
			(cloths) is the honorific form of the noun གོ་
			ལ་/gola/(cloths), གསངས་/sung/(tell) the honorific
			form of the verb སབ་/lab/(tell). We opted to mark
			them by adding the tag NNH (honorific
			common noun) and VBH (honorific verb) to
			enable future research on this specific usage of
			Dzongkha language. A number of tags were
			added to the set, of which we describe four in
			more detail: two of the additional tags are subclasses
			of verbs: VBH (honorific verb form),
			and VBN which describes past participle forms,
			like, e.g. བངམ་/jun/(created), the past particle
			form of བང་/jung/(create).
			(Chungku et al. 2010)
			
			A noun, which indicates respect for the person being addressed, e.g., Miwang Gel-poi Yab “A king's father” [Though father=Apa, but colloquially we say YAB in Dzongkha]

 10: NominalQuantifier : A noun which quantifies one or more things, regardless of subject and an object.
			
			ང་གིས་ བམོ་ ལ་ དང་ ཕད་ཅི།
			NGAGI BUM 'NGA 'DA CHECI
			I girl five with met
			“I met with five girls.”
			(Jurmey Rabgay, email Sep 20, 2010)
 11: Noun : 
	A noun, or noun substantive, is a part of speech (a word or phrase) which can co-occur with 
	(in)definite articles and attributive adjectives, and function as the head of a noun phrase.

	The word "noun" derives from the Latin 'nomen' meaning "name", and a traditional definition 
	of nouns is that they are all and only those expressions that refer to a person, place, 
	thing, event, substance, quality, idea or an appointment. They serve as the subject or object 
	of a verb, and the object of a preposition.
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 12: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 13: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)
		
			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.

 17: PossessiveAdjective : Adjective/Type="possessive" are denominal, not pronominal expressions of possession (Ivan A Derzhanski, email 2010/06/09). Therefore not to be confused with Pronoun/Type=adjectival(a) (Bulgarian only), for words like умно /cleverly, wisely, sensibly/, which are derived from adjectives. (Dimitrova et al. 2009)

			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#PossessiveAdjective)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#stringA PossessiveAdjective is an denominal adjective, often derived from a ProperNoun, that serves to indicate possession in most Slavic languages. 
		Unlike a genitival construction, a possessive adjective shows agreement with its head noun. (Chiarcos)
 18: PossessiveArticle : In Romanian,  the possessive article (also called genitival article) is an element in the structure of the possessive pronoun, of the ordinal numeral (e.g. al meu (mine) and al treilea (the third)), and of the indefinite genitive forms of the nouns (e.g. capitol al cărţii (chapter of the book)), e.g., -al/al, a/al, ai/al, al, ale/al, alor/al (http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#PossessiveArticle)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 19: PossessiveDeterminer : 
			A possessive determiner is a part of speech that modifies a noun 
			by attributing ownership to someone or something.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_adjective 19.09.06)
		
 20: PossessiveParticle : 
                            Particle expressing ownship.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1895)
                            
 21: PossessivePronoun : 
			A possessive pronoun is a pronoun that expresses relationships like ownership, such as kinship, and other forms of association.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPossessivePronoun.htm 19.09.06)
		
 22: PossessiveRelativePronoun : A relative pronoun whose antecedent is the possessor of the subject or object in the relative clause.
 23: ProperNoun : 
		Proper nouns (also called proper names) are the names of unique entities. 
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 24: ReflexivePossessiveDeterminer : Attributive possessive pronoun form of the reflexive pronoun, e.g., Russian свой:
		
		Обама на свой день рождения угощал гостей стейками и хот-догами.
		Obama on his day of.birth entertained guests with.steaks and hot.dogs
		"On his birthday, Obama entertained his guests with steaks and hot dogs." (http://ua.rian.ru/world_news/20110805/78815136.html)
		
		The antecedent of a possessive reflexive is not determined by its gender, but by its syntactic prominence.
		
 25: RelationNoun : 
                            relation noun

 26: SpatiotemporalNoun : 
			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has

			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)

 27: TimeNoun : noun expressing time
 28: TitleNoun : A title designates the function or the social status of an individual. Often, it accompanies a proper noun, but it can also be used in place of a proper noun (if the bearer of the title is contextually unambiguous).
			E.g. "The/Det German/Adj Chancellor/Title Angela/Name Merkel/Name said ..." can be used besides "the German Chancellor said ...".
			Accordingly, some schemes (e.g., Chungku et al. 2010, for Dzongkha) group titles together with proper names (http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#ParticularPersonNoun).
			
			However, if multiple people hold the same title, they can be referred to as a group, e.g., "Since WWII, the politics of the German chancellors always followed ...", and in this usage, 
			titles are more comparable to common nouns.
			Functionally, titles are thus an intermediate category between CommonNoun and ProperNoun (cf. also Mulkern 1996).
			
			Titles do, however, share important characteristics with common nouns. 
			In English, for example, titles generally require a definite determiner (unlike proper nouns), even if unambiguous ("the pope"). 
			They are thus classified here as a subtype of CommonNoun.

 29: UnitNoun : Measuring units are frequently used with numerals. However, they have a different syntactic structure than
			numerals (Sajjad 2007). 
			
			In European languages, Units are generally expressed as nouns, e.g., English "ten/Numeral kilogram/Unit".
			"Kilogram" can also be used as a common noun: "The kilogram is losing weight" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12276822)

book or whose daughter, or consisting of a wh-pronoun like who.

WHNP
â ´ Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter, none of which, or how many leopards.

 1: CommonNoun : 
		A common noun is a noun that signifies a non-specific member of a group.
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsACommonNoun.htm 19.09.06)
	
 2: CountableNoun : 
		A countable noun (also count noun) is a noun which can be modified by a numeral 
		and occur in both singular and plural form, as well as co-occurring with 
		quantificational determiners like every, each, several, most, etc..
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_noun 19.09.06)
	
 3: DiminutiveNoun : 
                            diminutive noun
                                (MIRACL LSCA; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2225)
                            
 4: ElativeNoun : noun to express both comparative and superlative
 5: HonorificCommonNoun : Dzongkha uses honorific forms: ན་བཟའ་/nam za/
			(cloths) is the honorific form of the noun གོ་
			ལ་/gola/(cloths), གསངས་/sung/(tell) the honorific
			form of the verb སབ་/lab/(tell). We opted to mark
			them by adding the tag NNH (honorific
			common noun) and VBH (honorific verb) to
			enable future research on this specific usage of
			Dzongkha language. A number of tags were
			added to the set, of which we describe four in
			more detail: two of the additional tags are subclasses
			of verbs: VBH (honorific verb form),
			and VBN which describes past participle forms,
			like, e.g. བངམ་/jun/(created), the past particle
			form of བང་/jung/(create).
			(Chungku et al. 2010)
			
			A noun, which indicates respect for the person being addressed, e.g., Miwang Gel-poi Yab “A king's father” [Though father=Apa, but colloquially we say YAB in Dzongkha]

 6: InstrumentNoun : noun expressing an instrument of the action
 7: IntensiveNoun : noun that emphasizes another noun
 8: MannerNoun : noun expressing a manner
 9: MassNoun : 
		A mass noun (also uncountable noun or non-count noun) can't be modified by a numeral, 
		occur in singular/plural or co-occur with the relevant kind of determiner.
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun 19.09.06)
	
 10: NominalPredicate : 
			A nominal predicate (noun or adjective), either with or without copula. 
			The term nominal predicate may be used for the complements of further 
			copulative verbs (cf. small clauses), e.g. "consider", "call", etc.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.5)
		
 11: NominalQuantifier : A noun which quantifies one or more things, regardless of subject and an object.
			
			ང་གིས་ བམོ་ ལ་ དང་ ཕད་ཅི།
			NGAGI BUM 'NGA 'DA CHECI
			I girl five with met
			“I met with five girls.”
			(Jurmey Rabgay, email Sep 20, 2010)
 12: Noun : 
	A noun, or noun substantive, is a part of speech (a word or phrase) which can co-occur with 
	(in)definite articles and attributive adjectives, and function as the head of a noun phrase.

	The word "noun" derives from the Latin 'nomen' meaning "name", and a traditional definition 
	of nouns is that they are all and only those expressions that refer to a person, place, 
	thing, event, substance, quality, idea or an appointment. They serve as the subject or object 
	of a verb, and the object of a preposition.
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 13: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 14: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)
		
			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NounPhrase)
		
 15: OnceNoun : noun conveying the meaning that the action is performed once
 16: PlaceNoun : noun expressing a location
 17: Predicate : 
			The predicate is the relation between the Clause and a portion of a  clause, excluding the subject, 
			that expresses something about the subject (Crystal 1980: 280; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 182; Pei and
			Gaynor 1954: 173; Pike and Pike 1982: 40; Mish et al. 1990: 926; Crystal 1985: 241-242).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/predicate)
		
 18: ProperNoun : 
		Proper nouns (also called proper names) are the names of unique entities. 
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun 19.09.06)
	
 19: QuestionPredicate : SQ â ´ Inverted yes/no question, or main clause of a wh-question, following the wh-phrase in SBARQ. 
(Bies et al. 1995)

SQ|That part of an SBARQ that excludes the wh-word or wh-phrase. See Section 5.32.
(Santorini 1991)

The SBARQ label marks wh-questions (i.e., those that contain a gap and therefore require a trace). A further level of structure, SQ, contains the inverted auxiliary (if there is one) and the rest of the sentence. The inverted auxiliary in wh-questions is not labeled. ...

SQ
(See also section 1.2.7.) 
â ¢	inside SBARQ:

As described above, inside wh-questions, SQ holds the subject, inverted auxiliary (if any), main verb phrase, and some adjuncts.
â ¢	yes/no questions: 

SQ is used for yes/no questions (i.e., those with inversion but no wh-movement). ...

â ¢	subject-less yes/no questions: 

In questions where the auxiliary and subject do not appear, the auxiliary is unlabeled and a null subject (NP-SBJ *) is used. ...

Note that questions with overt subjects and auxiliaries that show declarative word order are simply labeled S.

â ¢	Tag questions: 

Tag questions are treated as an adjunction of SQ to S. The resulting structure is labeled SQ, since the whole thing is interrogative in nature. The lower SQ is annotated to show predicate deletion; that is, an appropriate null *?* is inserted. 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 20: RelationNoun : 
                            relation noun
                                (MIRACL &amp; LSCA; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2226)
                            
 21: SpatiotemporalNoun : 
			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."

			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)

 1: DirectObject : 
		A direct object is a grammatical relation that exhibits a combination of certain 
		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object 
		relations previously established in other languages. This may be done by analyzing 
		correspondence between  translation equivalents (Crystal 1985: 94; Hartmann and 
		Stork 1972: 155; Mish et al. 1990: 358; Comrie 1989: 66; Andrews, Avery 1985:

			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of    
			 expressing the semantic role of goal and other similar roles. It is

			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following:

				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number

			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)

			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject

 1: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

 6: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.

		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object 
		relations previously established in other languages. This may be done by analyzing 
		correspondence between  translation equivalents (Crystal 1985: 94; Hartmann and 
		Stork 1972: 155; Mish et al. 1990: 358; Comrie 1989: 66; Andrews, Avery 1985: 
		68,120,126; Comrie 1985a: 337).

 2: FacultativePrepositionalObject : facultative (i.e. optional) prepositional object, e.g., passivized subject (von-phrase)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: IndirectObject : 
			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of    
			 expressing the semantic role of goal and other similar roles. It is 
			 proposed for languages in    which the role is distinct from the 
			 direct object and the oblique object on the basis of multiple    
			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following: 
				(i) Having a particular case marking, commonly dative 
				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number 
				(iii) Being distinct from oblique relations in that it may be relativized 
			 A noun, pronoun, or    noun phrase indicating the recipient or beneficiary of the action of a verb and its direct object   
			 (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1310)
			 
			 Third argument of a ditransitive verb. Ditransitive recipient (Siewierska 2004:57).
			 (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#R)
		
 4: PrepositionalObject : Prepositional object^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 5: SyntacticObject : 
			In linguistics, the object of a transitive verb is one of its core 
			arguments, which generally represents the target of the verb's action or 
			the undergoer of its effects. In more general terms, an object is a 
			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)
			
			An object, traditionally defined, is either a direct object or an indirect object. 
			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject 
			(Crystal 1985: 211; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 155-156; Mish et al. 1990: 814, Comrie 1989: 66).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/object)
		
 6: TransitiveObject : 
			Second argument of a transitive verb, transitive object (P)

 1: Possessive : 
                            Relative to the possession or association.
                                (www.wordreference.com/English/definition.asp?en=possessive; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1355)
                            
 2: PossessiveAdjective : Adjective/Type="possessive" are denominal, not pronominal expressions of possession (Ivan A Derzhanski, email 2010/06/09). Therefore not to be confused with Pronoun/Type=adjectival(a) (Bulgarian only), for words like умно /cleverly, wisely, sensibly/, which are derived from adjectives. (Dimitrova et al. 2009)
			e.g., Slovene dušikovima/dušikov, Marsovi/Marsov,
			Slovak vojvodova/vojvodov, vojvodove/vojvodov, vojvodovej/vojvodov, vojvodovho/vojvodov, vojvodovi/vojvodov, vojvodovmu/vojvodov, vojvodovo/vojvodov, vojvodovom/vojvodov, vojvodovou/vojvodov,

			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#PossessiveAdjective)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#stringA PossessiveAdjective is an denominal adjective, often derived from a ProperNoun, that serves to indicate possession in most Slavic languages. 
		Unlike a genitival construction, a possessive adjective shows agreement with its head noun. (Chiarcos)
 3: PossessiveArticle : In Romanian,  the possessive article (also called genitival article) is an element in the structure of the possessive pronoun, of the ordinal numeral (e.g. al meu (mine) and al treilea (the third)), and of the indefinite genitive forms of the nouns (e.g. capitol al cărţii (chapter of the book)), e.g., -al/al, a/al, ai/al, al, ale/al, alor/al (http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#PossessiveArticle)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: PossessiveDeterminer : 
			A possessive determiner is a part of speech that modifies a noun 
			by attributing ownership to someone or something.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_adjective 19.09.06)
		
 5: PossessiveParticle : 
                            Particle expressing ownship.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1895)
                            
 6: PossessivePronoun : 
			A possessive pronoun is a pronoun that expresses relationships like ownership, such as kinship, and other forms of association.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPossessivePronoun.htm 19.09.06)
		
 7: PossessiveRelativePronoun : A relative pronoun whose antecedent is the possessor of the subject or object in the relative clause.
 8: ReflexivePossessiveDeterminer : Attributive possessive pronoun form of the reflexive pronoun, e.g., Russian свой:
		
		Обама на свой день рождения угощал гостей стейками и хот-догами.
		Obama on his day of.birth entertained guests with.steaks and hot.dogs
		"On his birthday, Obama entertained his guests with steaks and hot dogs." (http://ua.rian.ru/world_news/20110805/78815136.html)
		
		The antecedent of a possessive reflexive is not determined by its gender, but by its syntactic prominence.
		
 9: SyntacticAdjunct : 
			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 1: ExpletiveArgument : 
			Three different expletive usages [of the German expletive pronoun es]
			are traditionally distinguished: formal subject or object (expletive argument), 
			correlate of an extraposed clausal argument (expletive correlate), and Vorfeld-es (structural expletive)
			(cf. (Eisenberg 1999 2001), (Pütz 1986)). ...
			
			The formal subject obligatorily occurs with weather verbs, e.g. "Es regnet" and unpersonal
			or agentless constructions such as "Es gibt so eine Buchung" or "Es geht um populäre Unterhaltung." 
			Some verbs optionally permit an expletive subject but also occur with referential subjects such as 
			"Max/Es kopft an der Tür." A formal object is found in constructions like
			"jmd. legt es an auf etw." or "jmd. verdirbt es mit jmdm." In all examples mentioned, es
			functions as a grammatical argument without semantic contribution, i.e. it does not refer
			to a person, object, or event.
			(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.60f)
		
 2: MeasureArgument : added in conformance with TIGER
 3: Positive : 
			Value used in a comparison relationship when no comparison is involved.
			(http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1420)
		
			The Positive is the form of an adjective or 
			adverb on which comparative and superlative are formed.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive  17.11.06)
		
 4: PostHodiernalFuture : 
			PostHodiernalFutureTense locates the situation in question after 
			the span that is culturally defined as 'today' (Bybee, Perkins, 
			and Pagliuca 1994: 247).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PostHodiernalFuture)

 5: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: SyntacticArgument : 
			An inherent (morpho)syntactic constituent subcategorized for by a predicate.&lt;br/&gt;
			'Arguments are those terms which are required by some predicate in 
			order to form a complete nuclear predication. They are essential to 
			the integrity of the SoA designated by the predicate frame. If we 
			leave them out, the property/relation designated by the predicate is 
			not fulfilled or satisfied.' (Dik, 1997:86f)&lt;br/&gt;
			An argument can be a controller in an agreement relation.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticArgument)&lt;br/&gt;
			
			The category ARG is assigned to those syntactic constituents that appear as obligatory complements 
			to the main verb. This means that they cannot be left out without a change in grammaticality or a 
			significant change in meaning.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

		A verb chunk having a gerund will be annotated as VGNN. For example,
		h18a. sharAba ((pInA_VM))_VGNN sehata ke liye hAnikAraka hE.
		'liquor' 'drinking' 'heath' 'for' 'harmful' 'is'
		“Drinking (liquor) is bad for health”
		h19a. mujhe rAta meM ((khAnA_VM))_VGNN acchA lagatA hai
		'to me' 'night' 'in' 'eating' 'good' 'appeals'
		“I like eating at night”
		h20a. ((sunane_VM meM_PSP))_VGNN saba kuccha acchA lagatA hE
		'listening' 'in' 'all' 'things' 'good' 'appeal' 'is'

 11: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 12: NonfiniteVerbPhrase : 
 13: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 14: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)
		
			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NounPhrase)
		
 15: Phrase : 
			Phrase is the class of syntactic constructions that consist of one or more 
			syntactic words, but lack the subject-predicate organization of a clause. 
			Phrases get their grammatical characteristics according to what word occupies 
			the head position; thus, all phrases have heads [Crystal 1980, 232-233; Pei 
			and Gaynor 1954, 169; Pike and Pike 1982, 453].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Phrase)
		
 16: Preposition : 
      A preposition is an adposition that occurs before its complement.
      (http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPreposition.htm 19.09.06)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 17: PrepositionalPhrase : 
			A sequence of a preposition and its complement is a prepositional phrase. The complement of a preposition is usually
			a noun phrase (see examples 38 to 40), but may also be a clause or an adverb phrase. According to the categories
			recommended here, a prepositional phrase may be analysed further into preposition and noun phrase. The examples
			below demonstrate how this further analysis can be a recursive procedure.

			(38)  	[PP en [NP sustitucion [PP de [NP los canales correspondientes [PP de [NP 50 baudios NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP].
			(39)  	[NP Fairbanks NP] [VP hummed [NP a few bars NP] VP] [PP in [NP a voice [VP made resonant 
					[PP by [NP the very weakness [PP of [NP his chest NP] PP] NP] PP] VP] NP] PP].
			(40)  	[PP En [NP el caso [PP de [NP un sistema mixto [PP en [NP el 
					[CL que [VP se utilicen [NP canales [PP con [NP tres velocidades 
					[PP de [NP modulacion NP] PP] diferentes NP] PP] NP] VP] CL] NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP]

			In a language such as Spanish, where a large proportion of the modification of nouns takes the form of a following
			preposition de and another noun, this recursion is extremely prevalent, as in 40. In cases where the prepositional
			phrase is complemented by a one word noun phrase, it may be advantageous to leave the analysis at this point, rather
			than continuing to analyse further by enclosing the complement (see also one-word constituents).

 18: SimplePreposition : 
                            Preposition that is a pure simple word in contrast with the notion of fused preposition.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1900)
                            
 19: VerbPhrase : 
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

			Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
			whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
			way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
			standard VP-tests. 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node33.html)
		
			VerbPhrase is the class of phrases that have verbs as heads. They can play the role of predicate in a main clause.

 6: SyntacticAdjunct : 
			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).

			A interrogative pronoun is a pro-form that is used in questions in place of the item questioned for.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInterrogativeProForm.htm 19.09.06)
		
 9: InterrogativePunctuation :

 12: PrepositionalAdverb : adverb which is very similar in its form to a preposition
 13: PrepositionalCase : 
			In many grammars, the term "prepositional case" is to refer to case marking that only occurs in 
			combination with prepositions. Normally, this is an oblique case, e.g., the Russian 6th case,
			also referred to as "locative". (Ch. Chiarcos)
		
 14: PrepositionalObject : Prepositional object^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 15: PrepositionalPhrase : 
			A sequence of a preposition and its complement is a prepositional phrase. The complement of a preposition is usually
			a noun phrase (see examples 38 to 40), but may also be a clause or an adverb phrase. According to the categories
			recommended here, a prepositional phrase may be analysed further into preposition and noun phrase. The examples
			below demonstrate how this further analysis can be a recursive procedure.

			(38)  	[PP en [NP sustitucion [PP de [NP los canales correspondientes [PP de [NP 50 baudios NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP].
			(39)  	[NP Fairbanks NP] [VP hummed [NP a few bars NP] VP] [PP in [NP a voice [VP made resonant 
					[PP by [NP the very weakness [PP of [NP his chest NP] PP] NP] PP] VP] NP] PP].
			(40)  	[PP En [NP el caso [PP de [NP un sistema mixto [PP en [NP el 
					[CL que [VP se utilicen [NP canales [PP con [NP tres velocidades 
					[PP de [NP modulacion NP] PP] diferentes NP] PP] NP] VP] CL] NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP]

			In a language such as Spanish, where a large proportion of the modification of nouns takes the form of a following
			preposition de and another noun, this recursion is extremely prevalent, as in 40. In cases where the prepositional
			phrase is complemented by a one word noun phrase, it may be advantageous to leave the analysis at this point, rather
			than continuing to analyse further by enclosing the complement (see also one-word constituents).

 1: AdjectivePhrase : 
			An adjective phrase may consist of an adjective, or a sequence of words in which an adjective is the head of the
			phrase, as shown in 47 to 50 below.

			(47)  	[NP his [ADJP surprisingly thick and hairy ADJP] wrists NP]

			AdjectivePhrase is the class of phrases that have adjectives as heads.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AdjectivePhrase)
		
 2: AdverbPhrase : 
			An adverb phrase may consist of an adverb, or a sequence of words in which an adverb is the head of the phrase.
			Adverb phrases may function as adverbials, as in 41:

			(41)  	[NP Her beautiful white hat NP] [VP was [ADVP very nearly ADVP] ruined VP]
			
			or as modifiers of adjectives, as in 42:
			
			(42)  	[NP Il NP] [VP parle [ADVP infiniment plus couramment ADVP] VP]

			or noun phrases, as in 43:

			(43)  	[NP They NP] [VP let [NP me NP] [VP speak VP] [ADVP now and then ADVP] VP]
			
			or as the complement of a preposition, as in 44:
			
			(44)  	[ADVP Strangely enough ADVP] , [NP we NP] [VP received [NP a reply NP] [NP the next day NP] VP]

			Other examples:

 3: ConjunctionPhrase : Multi-word conjunction
	
	Besides the usual and, or, but, etc., certain prepositions and subordinating conjunctions can be used as coordinating conjunctions. Multi-word coordinating conjunctions are labeled CONJP (see section 7 [Coordination]). ...
CONJP — Conjunction Phrase. Used to mark certain “multi-word” conjunctions, such as as well as, instead of. 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: DeterminerPhrase : 
		Certain pronouns serving as determiners in noun phrases may be premodified, for instance, 
		by degree adverbs such as in German "so viele ¨Altere", "gar kein Schutz", etc.
		In the case of "so viele Ältere", the premodifying adverb so is attached to the indefinite
		pronoun viele. Together, they form a determiner phrase (DP), which is attached to the
		head noun Ältere on the same level: [so viele] Ältere
		(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.63)
		
 5: FacultativePrepositionalObject : facultative (i.e. optional) prepositional object, e.g., passivized subject (von-phrase)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: FiniteVerbPhrase : 
 7: ForeignPhrase : 
		Single foreign words are projected to a syntactic level assigned the node label FX, which is
		an universal label for any syntactic category (phrasal and sentential) in the respective
		foreign language.
		(Telljohann et al. 2009, p.44)
		
 8: GerundVerbPhrase : 
		VGNN Gerunds
		A verb chunk having a gerund will be annotated as VGNN. For example,
		h18a. sharAba ((pInA_VM))_VGNN sehata ke liye hAnikAraka hE.
		'liquor' 'drinking' 'heath' 'for' 'harmful' 'is'
		“Drinking (liquor) is bad for health”
		h19a. mujhe rAta meM ((khAnA_VM))_VGNN acchA lagatA hai
		'to me' 'night' 'in' 'eating' 'good' 'appeals'
		“I like eating at night”
		h20a. ((sunane_VM meM_PSP))_VGNN saba kuccha acchA lagatA hE
		'listening' 'in' 'all' 'things' 'good' 'appeal' 'is'

 9: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
 10: NonfiniteVerbPhrase : 
 11: NounHeadedPhrase : 
			A NounHeadedPhrase takes a nominal as its (semantic) head. 
			Introduced as a generalization over NounPhrase and PrepositionalPhrase for reasons of consistency with dependency parsers like 
			Connexor where this differentiation is not made.
		
 12: NounPhrase : 
			At phrase level, the noun phrase is probably the least problematic of the categories to be dealt 
			with. In general, a noun phrase will a have noun or a pronoun as its head, and included within 
			the noun phrase are the determinative elements, any premodification, and any postmodification. 
			The examples below, 14 to 17 show noun phrases with the head noun/pronoun in bold:

			(14)  	[NP He NP] was a tiny man
			(15)  	[NP his white shirt cuffs NP]
			(16)  	[NP his surprisingly thick and hairy wrists NP]
			(17)  	[NP some wholly unanticipated but remotely possible event of absorbing interest NP]

			However, noun phrases may also occur with adjectival heads, as in 18 and 19:

			(18)  	[NP The unemployed NP] have had enough
			(19)  	We've beaten [NP the best NP]

			or with a head which is a cardinal or ordinal number, as in 20 and 21:

			(20)  	[NP The ninth NP] is my particular favourite
			(21)  	[NP The other seven NP] continued with the trip
			
			In `pro-drop' languages, such as Spanish and Italian, pronominal Subjects are usually not expressed. 
			Depending on the chosen type of analysis, this may require another definition of noun phrase, in order 
			to include `empty noun phrases', in which the pronoun is not actually present, but may be inferred 
			from the verb ending.

			A classic constituency test for Noun Phrases is that only whole NPs can be moved within the same sentence. 
			In English, constituents can be preposed to achieve some effect, as in 23 (from Radford 1988: 70):

			(22)  	I can't stand your elder sister
			(23)  	Your elder sister I can't stand (though your brother's OK).
			
			Examples 24 and 25 show that it is not possible to move only part of the NP:

			(24)  	*Your elder I can't stand sister
			(25)  	*Elder sister, I can't stand your

			However, this test should be used with caution. It works well in English, but not always in other languages. 
			For example, in 26 Neue Bücher is moved to the beginning of the sentence while keine is left at the end:

			(26) 	Neue	Bücher	habe	ich	keine
					new	books	have	I	no
					`I have not got any new books'
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node32.html)
		
			NounPhrase is the class of phrases that have nouns as heads. They can play the role of subject 
			in a main clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NounPhrase)
		
 13: Phrase : 
			Phrase is the class of syntactic constructions that consist of one or more 
			syntactic words, but lack the subject-predicate organization of a clause. 
			Phrases get their grammatical characteristics according to what word occupies 
			the head position; thus, all phrases have heads [Crystal 1980, 232-233; Pei 
			and Gaynor 1954, 169; Pike and Pike 1982, 453].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Phrase)
		
 14: PrepositionalAdverb : adverb which is very similar in its form to a preposition
 15: PrepositionalCase : 
			In many grammars, the term "prepositional case" is to refer to case marking that only occurs in 
			combination with prepositions. Normally, this is an oblique case, e.g., the Russian 6th case,
			also referred to as "locative". (Ch. Chiarcos)
		
 16: PrepositionalObject : Prepositional object^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 17: PrepositionalPhrase : 
			A sequence of a preposition and its complement is a prepositional phrase. The complement of a preposition is usually
			a noun phrase (see examples 38 to 40), but may also be a clause or an adverb phrase. According to the categories
			recommended here, a prepositional phrase may be analysed further into preposition and noun phrase. The examples
			below demonstrate how this further analysis can be a recursive procedure.

			(38)  	[PP en [NP sustitucion [PP de [NP los canales correspondientes [PP de [NP 50 baudios NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP].
			(39)  	[NP Fairbanks NP] [VP hummed [NP a few bars NP] VP] [PP in [NP a voice [VP made resonant 
					[PP by [NP the very weakness [PP of [NP his chest NP] PP] NP] PP] VP] NP] PP].
			(40)  	[PP En [NP el caso [PP de [NP un sistema mixto [PP en [NP el 
					[CL que [VP se utilicen [NP canales [PP con [NP tres velocidades 
					[PP de [NP modulacion NP] PP] diferentes NP] PP] NP] VP] CL] NP] PP] NP] PP] NP] PP]

			In a language such as Spanish, where a large proportion of the modification of nouns takes the form of a following
			preposition de and another noun, this recursion is extremely prevalent, as in 40. In cases where the prepositional
			phrase is complemented by a one word noun phrase, it may be advantageous to leave the analysis at this point, rather
			than continuing to analyse further by enclosing the complement (see also one-word constituents).

			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node34.html#SECTION00052500000000000000)
		
 18: VerbPhrase : 
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

			Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
			whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
			way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
			standard VP-tests. 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node33.html)
		
			VerbPhrase is the class of phrases that have verbs as heads. They can play the role of predicate in a main clause.

 4: AttributivePronoun : 
			An attributive pronoun is a pronoun that modifies an NP.
		
 5: CollectivePronoun : A pronoun that refers to all elements of a set.
 6: ConditionalPronoun : 
                            conditional pronoun
                                (MIRACL &amp; LSCA; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2222)
                            
 7: DemonstrativePronoun : 
			Demonstrative pronouns are deictic words (they depend on an external frame of reference). 
			They indicate which entities a speaker refers to, and distinguishes those entities from others. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrative_pronoun 19.09.06)
		
 8: DeterminalPronoun : The Estonian determinal pronouns _ise_, _end(a)_ `(one)self'." combine aspects of emphatic pronouns and reflexive pronouns.
			It could also be described as an intensifier that is formally identical with the reflexive pronoun or as an emphatic reflexive pronoun.
			(Ivan A. Derzhanski, Heiki-Jaan Kaalep, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#DeterminalPronoun;
			Insa Gülzow (2006), The acquisition of intensifiers: Emphatic reflexives in English and German child language, Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, p. 258)
		
 9: DifferentialPronoun : A pronoun, which classifies or differentiates(pronoun) by a single basis, like everybody; each; individual etc. 
			
			འ ག་པ ་ ་ ར་ ག་ར་ ན་ ང་ ང་ཁ་ ས་ད །
			Drupai Miser Gara Enrung Dzongkha ShegÔ
			'Every Bhutanese must know Dzongkha'
			(http://panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Bhutan/Papers/2007/0701/PartOfSpeech.pdf)
 10: DistributivePronoun : 
			When the subject is conjoined, the reflexive cannot refer to only one of them. The proform has to be a distributive pronoun, i.e., the reduplicated form, when it has coreference to respective subjects, e.g.,			
			*kumaarum_i/Kumar.and umaavum_j/Uma.and tan_i+j/self-poss puunekki/cat.to paalu/milk kuDuttaanaanga/give-pst-aggr.
			"*Kumar_i and Uma gave milk to his_i/her_j cat."
			(Annamalai 2000, p. 189, on Tamil)
			
			Unlike reciprocals, the two parts of a distributive pronoun cannot be considered as two full, independent NPs. In "awar/1 awar/2", only "awar/2" is case marked; "awar/1" is its citation form. Also, the two parts cannot be separated by intervening material (cf. English "one another").
			(Jayaseelan 2000, p. 149, on Malayalam)

 14: ExpletivePronoun :

			but complete a sentence to make it grammatical [Crystal 1997, 127]

			"has no meaning, but complete a sentence to make it grammatical" is a copula (see AuxiliaryVerb).
		
 15: FamiliarSecondPersonPronoun :

                                (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1426)
								
							More precisely, a form of pronoun that denotes the absence of a concrete or specific referent, e.g., German "man".
							As opposed to IndefinitePronoun, this referent is not just discourse-new, but generic or hypothetical.
                            
 21: IndefinitePronoun : 
		An indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that belongs to a class whose members

 25: NonspecificPronoun : In the Russian MTE v4 specs, Pronoun/Type="nonspecific" marks the following Russian words: весь 'all', всякий 'any, every', сам 'oneself', самый 'the very', каждый 'every, each', иной 'other', любой 'any', другой 'other'. The name "nonspecific" follows Halliday (1985, Section 6.2.1.1). (MTE v4)
			
			A nonspecific pronoun refers to an unidentified or general entity (e.g., "I saw *someone*", "I saw *everyone*"). A nonspecific pronoun is not, therefore, a personal pronoun, but an indefinite one. (Andrews 2003).

 27: PersonalPronoun : 
			A personal pronoun is a pronoun that expresses a distinction of person deixis. 		
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPersonalPronoun.htm 19.09.06)
			
			Note that (despite the SIL definition), an olia:PersonalPronoun refers to irreflexive personal pronouns. Personal pronoun categories without reflexivity sensitivity should be mapped onto olia:PersReflPronoun. (CC)
		
 28: PoliteSecondPersonPronoun : 
			In several European languages exist special forms of pronouns for polite or respectful reference,
			e.g. Dutch u and Spanish usted.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1p 19.09.06)

        (www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPronominal.htm; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1369)
	
 34: PronounOrDeterminer : 
		The parts of speech Pronoun, Determiner and Article heavily overlap in their formal and functional 
		characteristics, and different analyses for different languages entail separating them out in 
		different ways.
		In Eagles, Pronouns and Determiners are placed in one `super-category'. For some descriptions it may 
		be thought best to treat them as totally different parts of speech.
		(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node17.html#recp 19.09.06)

 2: SyntacticSubject : 	
        The subject of a sentence is one of the two main parts of a sentence, 
        the other being the predicate. Providing an adequate definition of the 
        notion of a subject is notoriously difficult, and depends on a range 
        of grammatical properties that may vary from language to language. For 
        this reason, many current grammatical theories avoid using the term, 
        except for purely descriptive purposes, or define it in terms of 
        occupying a particular position in the clause. The term subject refers 
        to the grammatical function an expression may have in relation to 
        other expressions in a sentence, and it should be distinguished from 
        parts of speech, which classify expressions independently of their 
        relations to other constituents of a sentence.

        The subject of a verb is the argument which generally refers to the 
        origin of the action or the undergoer of the state shown by the verb. 
        However, this definition depends on the particular language under 
        consideration. In languages where a passive voice exists, the subject 
        of a passive verb may be the target or result of the action. This is a 
        semantic definition. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)).

The interpretation is restricted to the application of pronouns.

 1: DirectObject : 
		A direct object is a grammatical relation that exhibits a combination of certain 
		independent syntactic properties, such as the following:  the usual grammatical 
		characteristics of the patient of typically  transitive verbs; particular case 
		marking; a particular clause  position; the conditioning of an agreement  affix 
		on the verb; the capability of becoming the clause subject in  passivization; the
		capability of reflexivization. The identification of the direct object relation 
		may be further confirmed by finding significant overlap with similar direct object 
		relations previously established in other languages. This may be done by analyzing 
		correspondence between  translation equivalents (Crystal 1985: 94; Hartmann and 
		Stork 1972: 155; Mish et al. 1990: 358; Comrie 1989: 66; Andrews, Avery 1985: 
		68,120,126; Comrie 1985a: 337).

 2: FacultativePrepositionalObject : facultative (i.e. optional) prepositional object, e.g., passivized subject (von-phrase)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: IndirectObject : 
			 An indirect object is a grammatical relation that is one means of    
			 expressing the semantic role of goal and other similar roles. It is 
			 proposed for languages in    which the role is distinct from the 
			 direct object and the oblique object on the basis of multiple    
			 independent syntactic or morphological criteria, such as the following: 
				(i) Having a particular case marking, commonly dative 
				(ii) Governing an agreement affix on the verb, such as person or number 
				(iii) Being distinct from oblique relations in that it may be relativized 
			 A noun, pronoun, or    noun phrase indicating the recipient or beneficiary of the action of a verb and its direct object   
			 (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1310)

			In linguistics, the object of a transitive verb is one of its core 
			arguments, which generally represents the target of the verb's action or 
			the undergoer of its effects. In more general terms, an object is a 
			patient.

			Verbs with no object (as in the sentence "I run") are called 
			intransitive verbs. Those which do take objects are called transitive 
			verbs. Transitive verbs which take only one object are known as 
			monotransitive. Ditransitive verbs have two objects, a patient and a 
			recipient. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28grammar%29).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticObject)
			
			An object, traditionally defined, is either a direct object or an indirect object. 
			An object, in some usages, is any  grammatical relation other than subject 
			(Crystal 1985: 211; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 155-156; Mish et al. 1990: 814, Comrie 1989: 66).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/object)
		
 14: TransitiveObject : 
			Second argument of a transitive verb, transitive object (P)

 1: NonReflexive : 
			A non-reflexive verb is a verb whose semantic agent and patient 
			(typically represented syntactically by the subject and the direct 
			object) are not the same. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_verbs  20.11.06)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 2: ReciprocalMiddle : 
			Referents of plural subject do action to one another. (Siewierska 1988:257)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ReciprocalMiddle)
		
 3: ReciprocalPronoun : 
			A reciprocal pronoun is a pronoun that expresses a mutual feeling or action among the referents of a plural subject.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAReciprocalPronoun.htm 19.09.06)
		
 4: Reflexive : 
			A reflexive verb is a verb whose semantic agent and patient (typically 
			represented syntactically by the subject and the direct object) are the 
			same. In many languages, reflexive constructions are rendered by transitive 
			verbs followed by a reflexive pronoun, as in English -self (e. g., She 
			threw herself to the floor.). (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_verbs  
			20.11.06)

 5: ReflexiveDeterminer : 
                            Determiner that refers to the same entity.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1377)
                            
 6: ReflexiveMiddle : 
			Reflexive middle makes use of 
			grammatical devices that normally indicate reflexivity.
			(Ch. Chiarcos)
		
 7: ReflexivePassive : 
			A Passive construction which contains reflexive markings. (Siewierska 1988:257)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ReflexivePassive)
		
 8: ReflexivePossessiveDeterminer : Attributive possessive pronoun form of the reflexive pronoun, e.g., Russian свой:
		
		Обама на свой день рождения угощал гостей стейками и хот-догами.
		Obama on his day of.birth entertained guests with.steaks and hot.dogs
		"On his birthday, Obama entertained his guests with steaks and hot dogs." (http://ua.rian.ru/world_news/20110805/78815136.html)
		
		The antecedent of a possessive reflexive is not determined by its gender, but by its syntactic prominence.
		
 9: ReflexivePronoun : 
			A reflexive pronoun is a pronoun that has coreference with the subject.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAReflexivePronoun.htm 19.09.06)
		
 10: ReflexiveVoice : 
			The reflexive voice is a grammatical voice in which the subject is both the agent and the patient or recipient.

 2: SyntacticSubject : 	
        The subject of a sentence is one of the two main parts of a sentence, 
        the other being the predicate. Providing an adequate definition of the 
        notion of a subject is notoriously difficult, and depends on a range 
        of grammatical properties that may vary from language to language. For 
        this reason, many current grammatical theories avoid using the term, 
        except for purely descriptive purposes, or define it in terms of 
        occupying a particular position in the clause. The term subject refers 
        to the grammatical function an expression may have in relation to 
        other expressions in a sentence, and it should be distinguished from 
        parts of speech, which classify expressions independently of their 
        relations to other constituents of a sentence.

        The subject of a verb is the argument which generally refers to the 
        origin of the action or the undergoer of the state shown by the verb. 
        However, this definition depends on the particular language under 
        consideration. In languages where a passive voice exists, the subject 
        of a passive verb may be the target or result of the action. This is a 
        semantic definition. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)).

 1: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 2: Clause : 
			Traditionally sentences are deemed to be composed of major constituents 
			known as clauses, which may be main clauses (not included in a superordinate 
			clause) or embedded clauses (included in a superordinate clause) such as 
			relative clauses or adverbial clauses. A main clause, unless it is coordinated, 
			is equivalent to a simple sentence, and does not need to be separately labelled. 
			Embedded and coordinated clauses, on the other hand, will need to be separately 
			identified. We recommend that such units be identified in the annotation, and 
			labelled either as sentences (S) or as clauses (CL), according to the preference 
			specified in the annotation scheme.

			The reason for allowing choice here is that different theoretical preferences 
			have to be accommodated. In some syntactic models, the `clause' category is not 
			used (except informally), embedded clauses being marked by included [S] 
			constituents. In other models, clauses are identified as such, even where they 
			are coextensive with an independent sentence.

			One solution which commends itself (and is employed in the Lancaster Treebank and 
			the SUSANNE Corpus) is to retain [S ... S] as the delimiter of sentences, whether 
			included or not, and also to use [S ... S] for the coordinated parts of a compound 
			sentence; but to use `clause' labels for subordinate clauses. An example which 
			illustrates this division is 12:

			(12)  	[S [S The distinction at issue is relatively clear S] , but [S closer 
					examination reveals [CL that all is not quite so straightforward 
					[CL as it seems CL] CL] S] . S]
					
			Embedded (subordinate) clauses are generally identified by some sign of their 
			dependence on the superordinate clause or sentence, such as an introductory 
			conjunction or a non-finite verb form. It is noticeable that the coordinated 
			parts of the compound sentence do not have to be clause-like units with subjects 
			and verbs, and to this extent [CL] would be a misleading label to apply to them. 
			This is true, in 13, of so far so good in:

			(13)  	[S [S So far so good S] , but [S now consider gender in adjectives S] . S] 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node31.html)
		
			Clause is the class of constructions that form minimal sentential units. 
			They must include a predicate, all arguments of the predicate, and all 
			modifiers of the predicate and the arguments.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Clause)
		
 3: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: ConditionalClause : 
			Conditional clauses refer to a hypothetical situation, in English they are introduced by 
			'if' or 'unless'.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#conditionalClause)
		
 5: CoordinateClause : 
			A coordinate clause is a clause belonging to a series of two or more clauses which are not 
			syntactically dependent on one another, and are joined by means of a coordinate conjunction, 
			a connective or parataxis.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/glossaryoflinguisticterms/WhatIsACoordinateClause.htm).
		
 6: CosubordinateClause : 
 7: EmbeddedInfinitive : 
			An infinitive is the head of the embedded construction. (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withInfinitiveAsHead)
			
			Infinitival relatives. See section 14 [Infinitives] for more information.

	                       (NP *T*-1))))))
	(Bies et al. 1995)
		
 8: FiniteClause : 
 9: MainClause : 
			MainClause is the class of clauses that can stand on their own as a full, independent sentence. 
			If a sentence contains any embedded clauses, the main clause is understood as the matrix plus 
			the embedded clauses. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 'John thinks that Mary 
			is sick' is the main clause [Crystal 2001, 231].
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/MainClause)

			The independent clause can stand by itself as a grammatically viable simple sentence. Multiple 
			independent clauses can be joined (usually with a comma and a coordinating conjunction) to form 
			a compound sentence (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#mainClause 
			with reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause).
		
 10: ReducedRelativeClause : RRC (reduced relative clause)
Reduced relative clauses are adjoined to the NP they modify. 
(Bies et al. 1995)

We will use the term \reduced relative clause" to refer to participial or adjectival constituents of the
type illustrated in (@26).

(26) He bought two watches designed by Paloma Picasso.

Reduced relative clauses should be bracketed as adjunction structures. The structure of ( 26) is thus as in
(@27). Note that the reduced relative clause, which is headed by a participle, is bracketed as a VP.

(27)
(S (NP He)
(VP bought
(NP (NP two watches)
(VP designed
(PP by
(PNP (PNP Paloma)
(PNP Picasso))))))
.)
(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 11: RelativeClause : 
			A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun. For example, the noun phrase 
			[the man who wasn't there] contains the noun [man], which is modified by the relative clause 
			[who wasn't there]
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#relativeClause with reference 
			to  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause and Dik 1997)
			
			There are three di erent types of relative clauses in English (be careful not to confuse relative clauses
			and complement clauses):
			(i) wh-relative clauses (a guy who(m) I know),
			(ii) that-relative clauses (a guy that I know), and
			(iii) zero relative clauses (a guy I know).
			(Santorini 1991)
		
 12: SubjunctiveModality : 
			The subjunctive is the mood that is minimally marked as opposed to 
			the indicative and that marks a clause as not directly representing 
			an assertion of the speaker. 
			(http://www.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/proxy.php?port=8080&amp;file=lido/servlet/Lido_Servlet Subjunktiv 18.06.07)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 13: SubjunctiveMood : 
			The subjunctive is the mood that is minimally marked as opposed to 
			the indicative and that marks a clause as not directly representing 
			an assertion of the speaker. 
			(http://www.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/proxy.php?port=8080&amp;file=lido/servlet/Lido_Servlet Subjunktiv 18.06.07)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 14: SubjunctiveParticle : In the Romanian MULTEXT-East scheme, a verbal particle with Particle/Type="future" modifies the verbs and marks the verb as being subjunctive, e.g., s-/să, să (Dan Tufis, email 2010/06/09, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#SubjunctiveParticle)
 15: SubjunctiveVerb : 
		A subjunctive verb is  typically used to expresses wishes, 
		commands (in subordinate clauses), emotion, possibility, 
		judgment, necessity, and statements that are contrary to 
		fact at present.
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood 19.09.06)
	
 16: SubordinateClause : 
			SubordinateClause is the class of clauses that cannot stand on their 
			own as sentences. A matrix clause combined with a subordinate clause 
			form a main clause. In the sentence 'John thinks that Mary is sick', 
			'Mary is sick' is the subordinate clause.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SubordinateClause)

			Dependent clauses (which are also sometimes referred to as subordinate 
			clauses) cannot stand alone as sentences. They usually begin with 
			subordinating conjunctions. A sentence with an independent clause and 
			any number of dependent clauses is referred to as a complex sentence. 
			One with two or more independent clauses and any number of dependent 
			clauses is referred to as a compound-complex sentence 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause, cf. 
			http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#subordinateClause).

			A subordinate clause is an embedded construction which contains a finite verb form. 			
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#finiteEmbeddedConstruction)
		
 17: SubordinatingConjunctionWithFiniteClause : 
			For example, in German the subordinating conjunction "weil" introduces 
			a clause with a finite verb.

 1: Superlative : 
			The superlative of an adjective or adverb is a form of adjective or 
			adverb which indicates that something has some feature to a greater 
			degree than anything it is being compared to in a given context. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superlative  17.11.06)
		
 2: SuperlativeCase : 
			SuperlativeCase expresses that  the referent of the noun it marks is the location onto 
			which another referent is moving. It has the meaning of 'onto'. Unfortunate name clash 
			with 'Superlative' as a property of adjectives.
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Superlative)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: SuperlativeParticle : 
                            Particle expressing superlative degree. Superlative is the comparison between more than two entities and contrasts with comparative where only two entities are involved and positive where no comparison is implied.
                                (Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1923)
                            
 4: SyntacticAdjunct : 
			Prototypically, an optional (morpho)syntactic constituent.

			'Satellites are not ... required by the predicate; they give 
			optional further information pertaining to additional features of the 
			SoA ..., the location of the SoA ..., the speaker's attitude towards 
			or evaluation of the propositional content ..., or the character of 
			the speech act...' (Dik, 1997:87)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticAdjunct)
			
			The category adjunct (ADJ) is assigned to those constituents that appear as optional additions, 
			be it to the main verb or to a given noun. This means that they can be left out freely without 
			a change in grammaticality or a significant change in meaning.
			In  "John called Mary (from school) (with his cell phone)"  the optional additions "from school" 
			and "with his cell phone" are such optional additions that can be left out freely.
			Adjuncts are generally used to convey additional information about the time, place, manner, or 
			cause of the event or situation described by the clause (see below). That is, they restrict the 
			class of events/  situations described by the clause to a subset. If required the category ADJ 
			can be split up into semantic sub-categories, that are annotated in layer semantic roles (time, 
			location, etc.).
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.3)

 2: Symbol : 
      In morphosyntactic annotation schemes, a symbol is a single graphical sign 
      that occurs in a written text with a conventionalized meaning but that
      does not represent a phoneme (like ordinary characters), an orthogaphic sign (punctuation),
      or a number. (Christian Chiarcos)
      
      Symbols such as alphabetic characters can vary for singular and plural 
      (e.g. How many Ps are there in `psychopath'?), and are in this respect 
      like common nouns. In some languages (e.g. Portuguese) such symbols also have gender.

 1: Qualifier : 
                            Also called MODIFIER : A word or phrase that qualifies the sense of another word; for example, the noun alarm is a modifier of clock in "alarm clock" and the phrase every day is an adverbial modifier of walks in "he walks every day"
                                (www.wordreference.com/English/definition.asp?en=modifier; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1373)
                            
 2: QualifierAdjective : 
                            Adjective used to qualify.

 3: SpatiotemporalNoun : 
			Noun denoting spatial and temporal expressions
			
			"A tag NST has been included to cover an important phenomenon of Indian languages. Certain expressions such as 'Upara' (above/up), 'nIce' (below) 'pahale' (before), 'Age' (front) etc are content words denoting time and space. These expressions, however, are used in various ways. For example,
			5.1.2.1 These words often occur as temporal or spatial arguments of a verb in a given sentence taking the appropriate vibhakti (case marker):
			h3. vaha Upara so rahA thA .
			'he' 'upstairs' 'sleep' 'PROG' 'was'
			“He was sleepign upstairs”.
			h4. vaha pahale se kamare meM bEThA thA .
			'he' 'beforehand' 'from' ' room' 'in' 'sitting' 'was'
			“He was sitting in the room from beforehand”
			h5. tuma bAhara bETho
			'you' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside”.
			Apart from functioning like an argument of a verb, these elements also modify another noun taking postposition 'kA'.
			h6. usakA baDZA bhAI Upara ke hisse meM rahatA hE
			'his' 'elder' 'brother' 'upstairs' 'of' 'portion' 'in' 'live' 'PRES'
			“His elder brother lives in the upper portion of the house”.
			5.1.2.2 Apart from occuring as a nominal expression, they also occur as a part of a postposition along with 'ke'. For example,
			h7. ghaDZe ke Upara thAlI rakhI hE.
			'pot' 'of' 'above' 'plate' 'kept' 'is'
			The plate is kept on the pot”.
			h8. tuma ghara ke bAhara bETho
			'you' 'home' 'of' 'outside' 'sit'
			“You sit outside the house”.
			'Upara' and 'bAhara' are parts of complex postpositions 'ke Upara' and 'ke bAhara' in (h6) and (h7) respectively which can be translated into English prepositions 'on' and 'outside'.
			For tagging such words, one possible option is to tag them according to their syntactic function in the given context. For example in 5.2.2 (h7) above, the word 'Upara' is occurring as part of a postposition or a relation marker. It can, therefore, be marked as a postposition. Similarly, in 5.2.1. (h3) and (h6) above, it is a noun, therefore, mark it as a noun and so on. Alternatively, since these words are more like nouns, as is evident from 5.2.1 above they can be tagged as nouns in all there occurrences. The same would apply to 'bAhAra' (outside)
			in examples examples (h4), (h5) and (h8).
			However, if we follow any of the above approaches we miss out on the fact that this class of words is slightly different from other nouns. These are nouns which indicate 'location' or 'time'. At the same time, they also function as postpositions in certain contexts. Moreover, such words, if tagged according to their syntactic function, will hamper machine learning. Considering their special status, it was considered whether to introduce a new tag, NST, for such expressions. The following five possibilities were discussed :
			a) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NN
			b) Tag both (h5) &amp; (h8) as NST
			c) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as NST
			d) Tag (h5) as NST &amp; (h8) as PSP
			e) Tag (h5) as NN &amp; (h8) as PSP
			After considering all the above, the decision was taken in favour of (b). The decision was primarily based on the following observations:
			(i) 'bAhara' in both (h5) and (h8) denotes the same expression (place expression 'outside')
			(ii) In both (h5) and (h8), 'bAhara' can take a vibhakti like a noun ( bAhara ko bETho, ghara ke bAhara ko bETho)
			(iii) If a single tag is kept for both the usages, the decision making for annotators would also be easier.
			Therefore, a new tag NST is introduced for such expressions. The tag NST will be used for a finite set of such words in any language. For example, Hindi has
			Age (front), pIche (behind), Upara (above/upstairs), nIce (below/down), bAda (after), pahale (before), andara (inside), bAhara (outside) etc."
		(Akshar Bharati, Dipti Misra Sharma, Lakshmi Bai, Rajeev Sangal (2006), AnnCorra : Annotating Corpora. Guidelines For POS And Chunk Annotation For Indian Languages, Tech. Rep., L anguage Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, version of 15-12-2006, http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/tr031/posguidelines.pdf)
		
			NLOC Noun Location
			This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon
			of Indian Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc.
			are used in various ways in Hindi.
			1. They act as a postposition along with 'ke'
			e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE.
			("pot" "on" "plate" "kept" "is")
			Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of
			the English preposition 'on'.
			2. They also act as adverbs.
			e.g. tuma upara jAo.
			("You" "up" "go")
			Here 'upara' is an adverbial of place.
			3. These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense
			behave like nouns.
			e.g. vaHa upara se AyA.
			("He" "above" "from" "came")
			4. As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act
			as arguments of the verb in the sentence. And they also take a post
			position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they behave
			like nouns.
			e.g. upara kA HissA
			("above" "of" "portion")
			To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category
			to which they belong in the given sentence. For example in 1. above,
			the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
			postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as
			an adverb and so on.
			But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3.
			and 4. above, and also if we consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara',
			etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them as
			nouns.
			But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location
			or time. These also function as adverbs or prepositions in a context.
			So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will cater to
			a finite set of such words.
			set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele)
			("front", "behind", "above", "below", "before")
			Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will
			hamper machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for
			such words which indicate location and time.
			
			e.g., (upara, Age, pahele, bAda)

 6: TenseMarkingAuxiliary : An auxiliary that marks exclusively tense, e.g., in Urdu:
			
			Auxiliaries:
			Based on the syntactic nature of Urdu, auxiliaries are divided into two categories. Aspectual
			auxiliaries always occur after main verb of the sentence. Tense auxiliaries are used to show the
			time of the action. They occurred at the end of the verb phrase. (Sajjad 2007).
			
			In Urdu, the auxiliary gā indicates future tense when it follows a verb in the subjunctive
			form. (http://purl.org/olia/emille.owl#GaAuxiliary)
		
 7: TenseMarkingParticle : Dzongkha has also a tense marker, which is not complicated like in other languages. It has got only six tense markers and can be used in a very simple and effective way. They are: ('Ni'+'Wong') for future, ('D'o'+'D'ä') for present and ('Ci'+'Yi') for past tense.
			
			ང་ ནངས་པ་ འ ་ །
			Nga naba jo-ni[past tense]
			I tomorrow go-will-[past]
			'I am going tomorrow'

			(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#Adjectival)
		
 2: AdjectivalAdverb : An adjectival adverb is an adverb that is formally identical to an adjective.&lt;br/&gt;		
			MULTEXT-East Adverb/Type="adjectival" (Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian)&lt;br/&gt;
			Bulgarian AdjectivalAdverbs have the same form as adjectives in Gender = neuter, Person = 3, Number = singular. (MTE v4, http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AdjectivalAdverb)
 3: AdjectivalModifier : 
			A nominal is modified by an adjective.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#adjectivalModifier)
		
 4: AdjectivalParticle : Particle that serves to form adjective phrases, e.g., Urdu sā (http://purl.org/olia/emille.owl#AdjectivalParticle)
 5: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 6: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticComplement)
		
 7: Transitive : 
			A predicate/verb that takes two arguments, e.g., English "to kiss", cf. van Valin and Lapolla (1997).
		
 8: TransitiveObject : 
			Second argument of a transitive verb, transitive object (P)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#P)
		
 9: TransitiveSubject : 
			First argument of a transitive or ditransitive verb.

 1: Adverbial : -ADV (adverbial)
— marks a constituent other than ADVP or PP when it is used adverbially (e.g., NPs or free (“headless”) relatives). However, constituents that themselves are modifying an ADVP generally do not get -ADV. 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 2: AdverbialModifier : 
			An adverbial modifier modifies a verb.

 3: AdverbialParticiple : Adverb/Type="participle" is used in the Slovene MTE v4 specs, e.g., 'leže' / lying. Slovenian adverbial participles are, however, not attested for Resian. (MTE v4)(http://purl.org/olia/mte/multext-east.owl#AdverbialParticiple)
 4: AdverbialSubordinateClause : 
			Subordinate clauses with adverbial function are annotated as ADV, e.g. "Tom sleeps when the sun rises."
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.6)
		
 5: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is

 4: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 2: InterrogativeCardinalQuantifier : interrogativeCardinalNumeral: An interrogative/relative word used to ask about quantity.
 3: InterrogativeDeterminer : 
			A interrogative is a function word used to introduce an interrogative clause.
			E.g. "which", "what", "whose" (interrogative possessive determiner) are  
			interrogative determiner in English.

 9: InterrogativeQuantifier : In the Czech and Slovak MTE v4 pecs, Numeral/Class="interrogative" are items meaning `how many/much', etc. Strictly speaking, they are pronumerals (pro-quantifiers), but traditional descriptions don't recognise such a category, so they are described variously as pronouns or as numerals (because their syntactic distribution is that of numerals, or very close)."

 1: EmbeddedInfinitive : 
			An infinitive is the head of the embedded construction. (http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withInfinitiveAsHead)
			
			Infinitival relatives. See section 14 [Infinitives] for more information.

	                       (NP *T*-1))))))
	(Bies et al. 1995)
		
 2: Infinitive : 
		An infinitive is the base form of a verb. 
		It is unmarked for inflectional categories such as the following: Aspect,  Modality, Number, Person and Tense.
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInfinitive.htm 19.09.06)
	
 3: InfinitiveParticle : 
                            Particle used to express infinitive.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1896)
                            
 4: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 5: InterrogativeAdverb : 
			Interrogative adverbs are used to introduce questions, e.g. "When are you coming?" (Angelika Adam)
		
 6: InterrogativeCardinalQuantifier : interrogativeCardinalNumeral: An interrogative/relative word used to ask about quantity.
 7: InterrogativeDeterminer : 
			A interrogative is a function word used to introduce an interrogative clause.
			E.g. "which", "what", "whose" (interrogative possessive determiner) are  
			interrogative determiner in English. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogative_word  02.05.07)
		
 8: InterrogativeModality : 
			The interrogative modality serves to indicate interrogative quality.

 11: InterrogativePronoun : 
			A interrogative pronoun is a pro-form that is used in questions in place of the item questioned for.
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnInterrogativeProForm.htm 19.09.06)
		
 12: InterrogativePunctuation : 
                            Punctuation used when the sentence is interrogative.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2087)
                            
 13: InterrogativeQuantifier : In the Czech and Slovak MTE v4 pecs, Numeral/Class="interrogative" are items meaning `how many/much', etc. Strictly speaking, they are pronumerals (pro-quantifiers), but traditional descriptions don't recognise such a category, so they are described variously as pronouns or as numerals (because their syntactic distribution is that of numerals, or very close)."

 1: AdnominalConstituent : 
			Adnominal wird jedes Element in einer Konstruktion bezeichnet, das der 
			Modifizierung eines Nomens dient, d.h. alle Formen von Attributen wie 
			Adjektive, Genitivattribute, PrÃ¤positionalattribute, RelativsÃ¤tze. Zum 
			Beispiel, das schÃ¶ne Haus; das Haus des Nachbars; das Haus am See; das 
			Haus, das ich mir schon immer gewÃ¼nscht habe. 
			(http://www.uni-trier.de/uni/fb2/ldv/ldv_wiki/index.php/Adnominal)
		@de
			Each element in a construction is called adnominal that modifies a 
			nominal, such as, all types of attributives, such as adjectives, possessives,
			prepositional attributes and relative clauses, such as the beautiful 
			house; the neighbour’s house, the house at the sea, the house, that I want.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#nominalModifier)
		@en
 2: ComplementClause : In noun phrases like the fact that she is late, the subordinate clause that she is late is a complement of
the noun fact and should not be confused with a relative clause. (Note that the embedded clause she is
late is not missing a constituent; by contrast, in a relative clause construction like the TV that she bought
the other day, the clause that she bought
the other day is incomplete.) The entire noun phrase should be
bracketed as a sister of the head noun.

(NP the fact 
(SBAR that
(S (NP she)
(VP is
(ADJP late)))))

(Santorini 1991)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 3: Nominal : -NOM (nominal)
— marks free (“headless”) relatives and gerunds when they act nominally. (See section 9 [WH-Phrases] for more information about free relatives, and section 13 [Gerunds and Participles] for more information about gerunds.) 
(Bies et al. 1995)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 4: NominalNumber : Nominal numbers are used to identify or refer the things. It does not show the quantity or rank.
			
			Example:
			ངེ་གི་ འགལ་འཕིན་ ཨང་གངས་ འདི་ ༡༧༦༤༩༠༣༧ ཨིན།
			NGIGI DRUELTHRIN ANGDRANG 'DI 17649037 INN
			my mobile number is 17649037 be
			“ My mobile number is 17649037.”
			(Jurmey Rabgay, email Sep 20, 2010, http://purl.org/olia/dzongkha.owl#NominalNumber)
 5: NominalPredicate : 
			A nominal predicate (noun or adjective), either with or without copula. 
			The term nominal predicate may be used for the complements of further 
			copulative verbs (cf. small clauses), e.g. "consider", "call", etc.
			(Dipper et al. 2007, §4.3.5)
		
 6: NominalQuantifier : A noun which quantifies one or more things, regardless of subject and an object.
			
			ང་གིས་ བམོ་ ལ་ དང་ ཕད་ཅི།
			NGAGI BUM 'NGA 'DA CHECI
			I girl five with met
			“I met with five girls.”
			(Jurmey Rabgay, email Sep 20, 2010)
 7: PostNominalModifier : 
			Postmodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify, describe, or qualify a preceding noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 8: PreNominalModifier : 
			Premodifying is a function of an adjective that can modify a following noun.
			(EAGLES)
			modificationType: Refers to the prenominal or postnominal positions of determiners which distinguish different forms. (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1931)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 9: SyntacticComplement : 
The complement is attached inside the VP, NP, ADJP, or PP. 

Verbs:
The term “complement” as it is used here refers to: 
1.	internal arguments such as NP objects, S and SBAR with no adverbial dash tags (including some if-clauses, as in I wonder if the Cubs are winning), and quoted constituents (including SINV and FRAG)
2.	the passive logical-subject by-phrase 
3.	VP 
4.	constituents tagged -BNF, -CLR, -DTV, -PRD, and -PUT
	
	  (S (NP-SBJ-1 the guide)
	     (VP was
	         (VP given
	             (NP *-1)
	             (PP-DTV to
	                     (NP Arthur))
	             (PP by
	                 (NP-LGS Ford)))))
	
	

Nouns: 
Since it is difficult to consistently annotate an argument/adjunct distinction, all PP modifiers of nouns are Chomsky-adjoined to the NP: 
	
	  (NP (NP a teacher)
	      (PP of
	          (NP chemistry)))

Adjectives: 
Except in comparatives, any modifier following an adjective is bracketed as a complement. 
	
	  (ADJP eager/likely/ready
	        (S to believe anything))
	
Prepositions: 
The NP or S complement of a preposition is placed inside the PP.

(Bies et al. 1995)
		
			A complement is a phrase that fits a particular slot in the syntax 
			requirements of a parent phrase 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_%28linguistics%29).
			An additional (morpho)syntactic constituent that may be subcategorized 
			for by the predicate.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#syntacticComplement)
		
 10: Transitive : 
			A predicate/verb that takes two arguments, e.g., English "to kiss", cf. van Valin and Lapolla (1997).
		
 11: TransitiveObject : 
			Second argument of a transitive verb, transitive object (P)
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#P)
		
 12: TransitiveSubject : 
			First argument of a transitive or ditransitive verb.

 1: AbilitativeMood : Abilitative is a mood that indicates ability, comparable to the use of "can" in English. (http://zbb.spinnwebe.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=34901)
 2: AgentiveVerb : 
		An agentive verb marks the semantic role of agent or the doer of an action.
		
		Example:
		་ ་ ས་ ་ ་ བསད་ ག།
		Dorji-gi jele sänu
		'Dorji killed the cat'
		(http://panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Bhutan/Papers/2007/0701/PartOfSpeech.pdf)
		
 3: AspirationalVerb : It is a verb, which indicates a strong desire to achieve something, without the doer.
			
			དག་པ ་ ང་ ་ ་བར་ ག།
			dag-pai zhing-lu kewa shÔ
			'May i be born in pure land'
			(http://panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Bhutan/Papers/2007/0701/PartOfSpeech.pdf)
 4: AuxiliaryVerb :     
		An auxiliary verb is a verb which accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase, 
		and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as 
		person, number, tense aspect, and voice. 
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnAuxiliaryVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
		Besides modal verbs ("semiauxiliary") and "strict" auxiliary verbs, also copulas 
		are classified under auxiliary verbs here, as this is a praxis applied in practically every
		EAGLES-conformant morphosyntactic annotation scheme.

		Part of speech referring to the set of verbs, subordinate to the main lexical verb which help 
		to make distinction in mood, aspect, voice etc.
        (Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1244)
        
 5: BaseForm : 
			Strong inflection is a characteristic of lexemes, not individual tokens.
			In traditional English tagsets, e.g., SUSANNE  or the PennTreeBank tagset, surface ambiguities are normally not resolved.
			Uninflected forms and forms that have the same form (e.g., "be" as an imperative) are tagged as BaseForm. (Ch. Chiarcos)
			
			Since it is impractical (...) to resolve automatically the 
			ambiguity of these six morphological functions, it is a common practice to assign a single value to the base form, 
			or else to assign two values, one for the finite and one for the non-finite functions. Because of this, the tables 
			below show two tagsets: one tagset representing the 6 attribute-values above, and a reduced tagset (`RTags'), which
			resembles most tagsets so far used for the English language in reducing the six values to two.
			http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/morphsyn/node150.html#SECTION00054000000000000000
			
			BaseForm is not a characteristic of lexemes, but specific to certain forms in a complex paradigm.

 8: ConditionalMood : 
      	In Inuktitut, conditionality is expressed by verbal inflection. Conditional mood signifies conditional relationships in a sentence. (Nowak 1996, p.39)
      	
      	A conditional relation is a logical relation in which the illocutionary act employing one of a pair of propositions is expressed or implied to be true or in force if the other proposition is true.

 10: ConditionalVerb : 
			A conditional verb is a verb form in many languages. It is used 
			to express degrees of certainty or uncertainty and hypothesis 
			about past, present, or future. Such forms often occur in 
			conditional sentences.

 11: DebitiveMood : Mood to express necessity or requirement
 12: DeclarativeMood : 
			Pertaining to the mood or mode of a verb form or clause such that it 
			predicates a type of (formal) assertion (OED).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#declarativeModality)
			
			Unlike DeclarativeModality, a DeclarativeMood is morphologically marked.

 15: FiniteVerb : 
		A finite verb is a verb form that occurs in an independent clause, and 
		is fully inflected according to the inflectional categories marked on 
		verbs in the language.  
		(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAFiniteVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
		Property applied to a verb form that can occur on its own in an independent sentence.
        (Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1287)
		
 16: FiniteVerbPhrase : 
 17: GerundVerbPhrase : 
		VGNN Gerunds
		A verb chunk having a gerund will be annotated as VGNN. For example,
		h18a. sharAba ((pInA_VM))_VGNN sehata ke liye hAnikAraka hE.
		'liquor' 'drinking' 'heath' 'for' 'harmful' 'is'
		“Drinking (liquor) is bad for health”
		h19a. mujhe rAta meM ((khAnA_VM))_VGNN acchA lagatA hai
		'to me' 'night' 'in' 'eating' 'good' 'appeals'
		“I like eating at night”
		h20a. ((sunane_VM meM_PSP))_VGNN saba kuccha acchA lagatA hE
		'listening' 'in' 'all' 'things' 'good' 'appeal' 'is'

 18: HabitualMood : "Habitual" is normally considered to be an aspect. Occasionally, it is, however, also described as a mood, e.g., by Bittner (2008, p. 354) for Kalaalisut (Greenlandic).

 19: HonorificVerb : Dzongkha uses honorific forms: ན་བཟའ་/nam za/
			(cloths) is the honorific form of the noun གོ་
			ལ་/gola/(cloths), གསངས་/sung/(tell) the honorific
			form of the verb སབ་/lab/(tell). We opted to mark
			them by adding the tag NNH (honorific
			common noun) and VBH (honorific verb) to
			enable future research on this specific usage of
			Dzongkha language. A number of tags were
			added to the set, of which we describe four in
			more detail: two of the additional tags are subclasses
			of verbs: VBH (honorific verb form),
			and VBN which describes past participle forms,
			like, e.g. བངམ་/jun/(created), the past particle
			form of བང་/jung/(create).
 20: ImperativeMood : 
			Pertaining to the mood or mode of a verb form or clause such that it 
			predicates a command, request, or exhortation (OED).
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#imperativeModality)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 21: ImperativeVerb : 
			An imperative verb is used to express commands, direct requests, and 
			prohibitions. Often, direct use of the imperative mood may appear
			blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, 
			read that book".
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Imperative_mood 19.09.06)

 22: ImpersonalVerb : 
                            (of a verb) having no logical subject. Usually in English the pronoun it is used in such cases as a grammatical subject, as for example in It is raining. (of a pronoun) not denoting a person
                                (www.wordreference.com/English/definition.asp?en=impersonal; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
                            An impersonal verb is a verb that - occurs only in third person singular forms - has no specified agent , and - has a dummy subject or no subject.
                                (www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnImpersonalVerb.htm; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
 23: IndicativeMood : 
		The indicative is the unmarked mood. It is used when no special modal 
		nuance in the clause or sentence is intended. It is the default mood 
		of independent declarative and often also of interrogative sentences. 
		(http://www.uni-erfurt.de/sprachwissenschaft/proxy.php?port=8080&amp;file=lido/servlet/Lido_Servlet Indikativ 18.06.07)
		
		Expression of assertion. (Bybee 1985:22) 
		Pertaining to the mood or mode of a verb form or clause such that it 
		predicates a stated relation of objective fact (OED).
		(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#indicativeModality)
	^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 24: IndicativeVerb : 
			Indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in 
			speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood 
			use the indicative. It is the most commonly used mood and is found 
			in all languages. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Indicative_mood 19.09.06)
		
 25: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

			non-actual or non-factual.

 27: LightVerb : In linguistics, a light verb is a verb participating in complex predication that has little semantic content of its own, but provides through inflection some details on the event semantics, such as aspect, mood, or tense. The semantics of the compound, as well as its argument structure, are determined by the head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V or V+N compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator verb, emphasising its role within the compound; or thin verb or semantically weak verb, emphasising (as with "light") its lack of semantics. A "semantically weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak inflection. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs in some ways.
			
			Most English light verbs occur in V+N forms sometimes called "stretched verbs": for example, take in take a nap, where the primary sense is provided by "nap", and "take" is the light verb. The light verbs most common in these constructions are also common in phrasal verbs. A verb which is "light" in one context may be "heavy" in another: as with "take" in I will take a book to read.
			
			Examples in other languages include the Yiddish geb in geb a helf (literally give a help, "help"); the French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, "pretend"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall, "start to leave"); and the bǎ construction in Chinese.[1] Some verbs are found in many such expressions; to reuse an earlier example, take is found in take a nap, take a shower, take a sip, take a bow, take turns, and so on. Light verbs are extremely common in Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, and other languages in which verb compounding is a primary mechanism for marking aspectual distinctions.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb)
 28: MainVerb : 
                            Main verb in contrast to a modal or an auxiliary.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1400)
								
								verb which has its own semantics (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-3004, plainVerb)
                            
 29: ModalVerb : 
			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.
            (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1329)
		
			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1v 20.09.06)
			
			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.

 30: NominalizedVerb : 
			A non-finite embedded construction which contains features 
			with nominal properties 
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withNominalProperites, 
			with reference to Dik 1997)
		
 31: NonAgentiveVerb : 
		A non-agentive verb is a type of verb, which indicates an action without the doer.
		
		Example:
		ང་མ་ འ ར་ ས།
		'lungma phur-dä
		'A wind is blowing'

 32: NonFiniteVerb : 
             Verb forms occurring on their own only in dependent clauses and lacking tense and mood contrasts.
			 (adapted from Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1332)
			 
			A non-finite verb is a verb that is not fully inflected for categories that are marked inflectionally in a language, 
			such as the following: Tense, Aspect, Modality, Number,  Person.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANonfiniteVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
 33: NonfiniteVerbPhrase : 
 34: OptativeMood : 
			Optative indicates that the speaker wishes or hopes that the expressed proposition 
			be the case (Bybee, Perkins, and Pagliuca 1994: 179; Palmer 2001: 204).
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Optative)
		
 35: PresumptiveMood : The presumptive mood is used in Romanian to express presupposition or hypothesis regarding the fact denoted by the verb, as well as other more or less similar attitudes: doubt, curiosity, concern, condition, indifference, inevitability. For example, acolo s-o fi dus "he might have gone there" shows the basic presupposition use, while the following excerpt from a poem by Eminescu shows the use both in a conditional clause de-o fi "suppose it is" and in a main clause showing an attitude of submission to fate le-om duce "we would bear".
			
			De-o fi una, de-o fi alta... Ce e scris și pentru noi,
			Bucuroși le-om duce toate, de e pace, de-i război.
			
			Be it one, be it the other... Whatever fate we have,
			We will gladly go through all, be it peace or be it war 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrealis_mood#Presumptive)
		
 36: QuotativeMood : A quotative is grammatical device to mark reported speech in some languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotative), e.g., in Estonian.&lt;br/&gt;
			
			‘Reportedly, while he was going (in his boat), he turned over.’
			Ta olevat        oma     paadiga   ümber läinud

 39: StrictAuxiliaryVerb : 
			Non-modal, non-copular auxiliary verb.
		
 40: SubjunctiveMood : 
			The subjunctive is the mood that is minimally marked as opposed to 
			the indicative and that marks a clause as not directly representing 
			an assertion of the speaker.

		commands (in subordinate clauses), emotion, possibility, 
		judgment, necessity, and statements that are contrary to 
		fact at present.

 43: Verb : 
		A verb is a part of speech that usually denotes action ("bring", "read"), 
		occurrence ("decompose", "glitter"), or a state of being ("exist", "stand"). 
		Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, 
		possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It may also agree with 
		the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb 19.09.06)

 44: VerbPhrase : 
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

 9: HonorificVerb : Dzongkha uses honorific forms: ན་བཟའ་/nam za/
			(cloths) is the honorific form of the noun གོ་
			ལ་/gola/(cloths), གསངས་/sung/(tell) the honorific
			form of the verb སབ་/lab/(tell). We opted to mark
			them by adding the tag NNH (honorific
			common noun) and VBH (honorific verb) to
			enable future research on this specific usage of
			Dzongkha language. A number of tags were
			added to the set, of which we describe four in
			more detail: two of the additional tags are subclasses
			of verbs: VBH (honorific verb form),
			and VBN which describes past participle forms,
			like, e.g. བངམ་/jun/(created), the past particle
			form of བང་/jung/(create).
 10: ImperativeVerb : 
			An imperative verb is used to express commands, direct requests, and 
			prohibitions. Often, direct use of the imperative mood may appear
			blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, 
			read that book".
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Imperative_mood 19.09.06)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 11: ImpersonalVerb : 
                            (of a verb) having no logical subject. Usually in English the pronoun it is used in such cases as a grammatical subject, as for example in It is raining. (of a pronoun) not denoting a person
                                (www.wordreference.com/English/definition.asp?en=impersonal; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
                            An impersonal verb is a verb that - occurs only in third person singular forms - has no specified agent , and - has a dummy subject or no subject.
                                (www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnImpersonalVerb.htm; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
 12: IndicativeVerb : 
			Indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in 
			speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood 
			use the indicative. It is the most commonly used mood and is found 
			in all languages. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Indicative_mood 19.09.06)
		
 13: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 14: LightVerb : In linguistics, a light verb is a verb participating in complex predication that has little semantic content of its own, but provides through inflection some details on the event semantics, such as aspect, mood, or tense. The semantics of the compound, as well as its argument structure, are determined by the head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V or V+N compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator verb, emphasising its role within the compound; or thin verb or semantically weak verb, emphasising (as with "light") its lack of semantics. A "semantically weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak inflection. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs in some ways.
			
			Most English light verbs occur in V+N forms sometimes called "stretched verbs": for example, take in take a nap, where the primary sense is provided by "nap", and "take" is the light verb. The light verbs most common in these constructions are also common in phrasal verbs. A verb which is "light" in one context may be "heavy" in another: as with "take" in I will take a book to read.
			
			Examples in other languages include the Yiddish geb in geb a helf (literally give a help, "help"); the French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, "pretend"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall, "start to leave"); and the bǎ construction in Chinese.[1] Some verbs are found in many such expressions; to reuse an earlier example, take is found in take a nap, take a shower, take a sip, take a bow, take turns, and so on. Light verbs are extremely common in Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, and other languages in which verb compounding is a primary mechanism for marking aspectual distinctions.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb)
 15: MainVerb : 
                            Main verb in contrast to a modal or an auxiliary.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1400)
								
								verb which has its own semantics (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-3004, plainVerb)
                            
 16: ModalVerb : 
			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.
            (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1329)
		
			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1v 20.09.06)
			
			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/morphsyn/node158.html#SECTION00054800000000000000)
		
 17: NominalizedVerb : 
			A non-finite embedded construction which contains features 
			with nominal properties 
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withNominalProperites, 
			with reference to Dik 1997)
		
 18: NonAgentiveVerb : 
		A non-agentive verb is a type of verb, which indicates an action without the doer.
		
		Example:
		ང་མ་ འ ར་ ས།
		'lungma phur-dä
		'A wind is blowing'
		(http://panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Bhutan/Papers/2007/0701/PartOfSpeech.pdf)
		
 19: NonFiniteVerb : 
             Verb forms occurring on their own only in dependent clauses and lacking tense and mood contrasts.
			 (adapted from Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1332)
			 
			A non-finite verb is a verb that is not fully inflected for categories that are marked inflectionally in a language, 
			such as the following: Tense, Aspect, Modality, Number,  Person.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANonfiniteVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
 20: NonfiniteVerbPhrase : 
 21: QuotativeVerb : A quotative is grammatical device to mark reported speech in some languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotative), e.g., in Estonian.&lt;br/&gt;
		
		‘Reportedly, while he was going (in his boat), he turned over.’
		Ta olevat        oma     paadiga   ümber läinud
		He was_QUOTATIVE his_own boat_WITH over  gone.&lt;br/&gt;
		
		(Estonian translation of an example given under http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAQuotativeEvidential.htm)
		(Heiki-Jaan Kaalep, email 2010/06/22)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 22: StrictAuxiliaryVerb : 
			Non-modal, non-copular auxiliary verb.
		
 23: SubjunctiveVerb : 
		A subjunctive verb is  typically used to expresses wishes, 
		commands (in subordinate clauses), emotion, possibility, 
		judgment, necessity, and statements that are contrary to 
		fact at present.
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood 19.09.06)
	
 24: Verb : 
		A verb is a part of speech that usually denotes action ("bring", "read"), 
		occurrence ("decompose", "glitter"), or a state of being ("exist", "stand"). 
		Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, 
		possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It may also agree with 
		the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb 19.09.06)
	^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 25: VerbPhrase : 
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

			Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
			whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
			way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
			standard VP-tests. 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node33.html)
		
			VerbPhrase is the class of phrases that have verbs as heads. They can play the role of predicate in a main clause.

 9: HeadOfNP : 
			The HeadFunction is a function of an adjective or participle that can serve as the focus of the phrase.

 10: HonorificVerb : Dzongkha uses honorific forms: ན་བཟའ་/nam za/
			(cloths) is the honorific form of the noun གོ་
			ལ་/gola/(cloths), གསངས་/sung/(tell) the honorific
			form of the verb སབ་/lab/(tell). We opted to mark
			them by adding the tag NNH (honorific
			common noun) and VBH (honorific verb) to
			enable future research on this specific usage of
			Dzongkha language. A number of tags were
			added to the set, of which we describe four in
			more detail: two of the additional tags are subclasses
			of verbs: VBH (honorific verb form),
			and VBN which describes past participle forms,
			like, e.g. བངམ་/jun/(created), the past particle
			form of བང་/jung/(create).
 11: ImperativeVerb : 
			An imperative verb is used to express commands, direct requests, and 
			prohibitions. Often, direct use of the imperative mood may appear
			blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, 
			read that book".

 12: ImpersonalVerb : 
                            (of a verb) having no logical subject. Usually in English the pronoun it is used in such cases as a grammatical subject, as for example in It is raining. (of a pronoun) not denoting a person
                                (www.wordreference.com/English/definition.asp?en=impersonal; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
                            An impersonal verb is a verb that - occurs only in third person singular forms - has no specified agent , and - has a dummy subject or no subject.
                                (www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnImpersonalVerb.htm; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1306)
                            
 13: IndicativeVerb : 
			Indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in 
			speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood 
			use the indicative. It is the most commonly used mood and is found 
			in all languages. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Indicative_mood 19.09.06)
		
 14: InfinitiveVerbPhrase : 
			VGINF Infinitival Verb Chunk
			This tag is to mark the infinitival verb form. In Hindi, both, gerunds and infinitive forms of the verb end with a -nA suffix. Since both behave functionally in a similar manner, the distinction is not very clear. However, languages such as Bangla etc have two different forms for the two types. Examples from Bangla are given below.
			b8. Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN SorIrera pokze BAlo
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'health-gen' 'for' 'good'
			‘Taking bath in the early morning is good for health”
			b9. bindu Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF BAlobAse
			'Bindu' 'morning' 'bath' 'take-inf' 'love-3pr'
			“Bindu likes to take bath in the early morning”
			In Bangla, the gerund form takes the suffix –A / -Ano, while the infinitive marker is –we. The syntactic distribution of these two forms of verbs is different. For example, the gerund form is allowed in the context of the word darakAra “necessary” while the infinitive form is not, as exemplified below:
			b10 Borabela ((snAna karA))_VGNN darakAra
			'Morning' 'bath' 'do-verbal noun' 'necessary'
			“It is necessary to take bath in the early morning”
			b11. *Borabela ((snAna karawe))_VGINF darakAra
			Based on the above evidence from Bangla, the tag VGINF has been included to mark a verb chunk.

 15: LightVerb : In linguistics, a light verb is a verb participating in complex predication that has little semantic content of its own, but provides through inflection some details on the event semantics, such as aspect, mood, or tense. The semantics of the compound, as well as its argument structure, are determined by the head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V or V+N compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator verb, emphasising its role within the compound; or thin verb or semantically weak verb, emphasising (as with "light") its lack of semantics. A "semantically weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak inflection. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs in some ways.
			
			Most English light verbs occur in V+N forms sometimes called "stretched verbs": for example, take in take a nap, where the primary sense is provided by "nap", and "take" is the light verb. The light verbs most common in these constructions are also common in phrasal verbs. A verb which is "light" in one context may be "heavy" in another: as with "take" in I will take a book to read.
			
			Examples in other languages include the Yiddish geb in geb a helf (literally give a help, "help"); the French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, "pretend"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall, "start to leave"); and the bǎ construction in Chinese.[1] Some verbs are found in many such expressions; to reuse an earlier example, take is found in take a nap, take a shower, take a sip, take a bow, take turns, and so on. Light verbs are extremely common in Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, and other languages in which verb compounding is a primary mechanism for marking aspectual distinctions.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb)
 16: MainVerb : 
                            Main verb in contrast to a modal or an auxiliary.
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1400)
								
								verb which has its own semantics (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-3004, plainVerb)
                            
 17: ModalVerb : 
			Verb form that is usually used with another verb to express ideas such as possibilities, permission, or intention.
            (Gil Francopoulo; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1329)
		
			A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, modal auxiliary) is a type of auxiliary 
			verb that is used to indicate modality. The use of auxiliary verbs to express modality 
			is characteristic of Germanic languages.
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb 19.09.06)
			
			In addition to main and auxiliary verbs, it may be useful (e.g. in English) to recognise an intermediate 
			category of semi-auxiliary for such verbs as be going to, have got to, ought to.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/annotate/node18.html#oav1v 20.09.06)
			
			The auxiliaries in English subdivide into the primary verbs `be', `have', and `do', which can also function 
			as main verbs, and the modal auxiliaries such as `can', `will', and `would', which are uninflected, and always 
			function as auxiliaries.
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/morphsyn/node158.html#SECTION00054800000000000000)
		
 18: NominalizedVerb :

			with nominal properties 
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#withNominalProperites, 
			with reference to Dik 1997)
		
 19: NonAgentiveVerb : 
		A non-agentive verb is a type of verb, which indicates an action without the doer.
		
		Example:
		ང་མ་ འ ར་ ས།
		'lungma phur-dä
		'A wind is blowing'
		(http://panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Bhutan/Papers/2007/0701/PartOfSpeech.pdf)
		
 20: NonFiniteVerb : 
             Verb forms occurring on their own only in dependent clauses and lacking tense and mood contrasts.
			 (adapted from Crystal 2003; http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1332)
			 
			A non-finite verb is a verb that is not fully inflected for categories that are marked inflectionally in a language, 
			such as the following: Tense, Aspect, Modality, Number,  Person.  
			(http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANonfiniteVerb.htm 19.09.06)
		
 21: NonfiniteVerbPhrase : 
 22: QuotativeVerb : A quotative is grammatical device to mark reported speech in some languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotative), e.g., in Estonian.&lt;br/&gt;
		
		‘Reportedly, while he was going (in his boat), he turned over.’
		Ta olevat        oma     paadiga   ümber läinud
		He was_QUOTATIVE his_own boat_WITH over  gone.&lt;br/&gt;
		
		(Estonian translation of an example given under http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAQuotativeEvidential.htm)
		(Heiki-Jaan Kaalep, email 2010/06/22)^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 23: StrictAuxiliaryVerb : 
			Non-modal, non-copular auxiliary verb.
		
 24: SubjunctiveVerb : 
		A subjunctive verb is  typically used to expresses wishes, 
		commands (in subordinate clauses), emotion, possibility, 
		judgment, necessity, and statements that are contrary to 
		fact at present.
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood 19.09.06)
	
 25: Verb : 
		A verb is a part of speech that usually denotes action ("bring", "read"), 
		occurrence ("decompose", "glitter"), or a state of being ("exist", "stand"). 
		Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, 
		possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It may also agree with 
		the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb 19.09.06)

 26: VerbPhrase : 
			This category is slightly more difficult to define, since there is disagreement over the extent of the verb phrase.
			In particular, should the verb phrase include only the words that are verbs, or should it also include the
			complements of the verb? In the examples given in this document, and in the sample texts in the appendices, we have
			chosen to include the complements, but it must be noted that this is an open issue, and we are in no way implying
			that this analysis is preferable to the alternative. The choice to be made at this level, i.e. the inclusion or
			exclusion of verbal complements in the Verb Phrase, is shown by the examples in 27 and 28, 27 showing the inclusion
			of the complement of the verb in the verb phrase and 28 excluding the complement:

			(27)  	He [VP took up [NP a clothes brush NP] VP]
			(28)  	He [VP took up VP] [NP a clothes brush NP]

			An advantage in the type of analysis shown in 27 is that the relative levels of the constituents can be shown to a
			greater extent -- i.e. complements of the verb are included in the verb phrase, while adjuncts and peripheral
			adverbials are left at sentence level.

			However, in a case where an adjunct occurs before the complement of the verb, the approaches used in 27 and 28 would
			cause problems, since either both the adjunct and the complement would be included as daughters of the verb phrase,
			or both would be daughters of the sentence, rather than keeping the complement as a daughter of the verb phrase and
			the adjunct as a sister of the verb phrase. These problems may be solved by an additional notation, but at some
			level, arbitrariness is inevitable.

			Regardless of the choice made over the extent of the Verb Phrase, there arises a problem of discontinuous Verb
			Phrases. A complex verbal construction may be discontinuous, e.g. the auxiliary and the main verb are separated in
			inverted constructions in English, or the main verb is positioned at the end of the sentence in German and Dutch.
			Such discontinuity can be avoided by having different labels and constituents for the auxiliary verb and the main
			verb, resulting in an analysis as shown in the Dutch example 29 below:

			(29)  	[NP Ze NP] [AUX zullen AUX] [ADVP er ADVP] [VP [NP de VN-agenda 
					[PP voor [NP het komende jaar NP] PP] NP] behandelen VP].
					
			and in the English interrogative inverted example 30, using the so-called `dummy auxiliary' do:

			(30)  	[AUX Do AUX] [NP they NP] [VP confide [PP in you PP] VP]?

			As with Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases can be identified by a constituency test. In strong constituency languages like
			English, the whole VP can be moved, but not part of it: compare 31 and 32:

			(31)  	  Give in to blackmail, I never will
			(32)  	*Give in, I never will to blackmail
			
			However, there are languages in which constituent tests do not work. These will typically be languages with flexible
			word order, such as Finnish. 33 is an example of a discontinuous VP (Vilkuna 1989: 26):

			(33)  	Maailmaa	nähnyt	hän	on.
			    	world-Part	seen	he	is
					`He IS a widely-travelled person.'

			For Finnish, then, evidence for a VP is less convincing than it is for English, and a dependency approach seems the
			more natural choice. (Covington (1990) provides a parsing strategy for variable word order languages and Covington
			(1991) for parsing discontinuous constituents, both using a dependency syntax approach.)

			In Italian also, constituency tests cannot be applied. This can be shown through the distribution of VP-adverbs
			(e.g. completamente `completely', intenzionalmente `intentionally', attentamente `carefully') and S-adverbs (e.g.
			probabilmente `probably', certamente `certainly'). In English, these different classes of adverbs have a different
			distribution within the sentence. In contrast, in Italian, the distinct adverb classes cannot be distinguished on
			the basis of their distribution in the sentence. S-adverbs and VP-adverbs can occur in the same positions within the
			sentence, as illustrated in examples 34 to 37:

			(34)  	Attentamente/certamente, il bambino ascoltó la storia
					`Carefully/certainly, the child listened to the story'
			(35)  	Il bambino attentamente/certamente ascoltó la storia
					`The child carefully/certainly listened to the story'
			(36)  	Il bambino ascoltó attentamente/certamente la storia
					`The child listened carefully/certainly to the story'
			(37)  	Il bambino ascoltó la storia attentamente/certamente
					`The child listened to the story carefully/certainly'

			Thus, in Italian as well as other languages, neither the position nor the syntactic context can help to decide
			whether an adverb is an S-adverb or a VP-adverb; this can only be stated by considering its semantic content and the
			way it relates to the content of the predicate or the sentence. This situation has consequences for the success of
			standard VP-tests. 
			(http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/segsasg1/node33.html)
		
			VerbPhrase is the class of phrases that have verbs as heads. They can play the role of predicate in a main clause.

 1: ActiveVoice : 
			When the subject is the agent or actor of the verb, 
			the verb is in the active voice. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_voice  17.11.06)
			
			Associated with transitivity, when the action is performed by an agent 
			(subject) on another participant (object), or with intransitivity 
			(McIntosh 1984:108). Refers to the category of underived verb forms 
			associated with the basic diathesis: Diathesis=D0:(X=SUBabs/nom) (Y=DIROBacc)
			(Shibatani 1995:7)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Active)
		
 2: AdjutativeVoice : voice for a construction where the subject of the verb is not an agent of the action denoted by the verb but is assisting an unstated agent in performing the action
 3: AntiCausativeVoice : An intransitive verb is derived from a basically
                        transitive one with the direct object of the transitive verb corresponding
                        to the subject of the intransitive [Siewierska 1988: 267].
 4: ApplicativeVoice : voice which promotes an oblique argument of a verb to the core patient argument and indicates the oblique role within the meaning of the verb
 5: CausativeVoice : voice where the subject causes someone or something else to do or be something
 6: CircumstantialVoice : voice that promotes an oblique argument of a verb to the role of subject
 7: DirectVoice : 
			Signals that the action proceeds in an ontologically salient way, 
			i.e. that salience is assigned to nominals based on their referent's 
			relative real-world capacities to control situations. (Klaiman 1991:32)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/DirectVoice)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 8: InverseVoice : 
			Signals when actions proceed from ontologically less salient to more 
			salient participants (Klaiman 1991:32)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/InverseVoice)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 9: MediopassiveVoice : voice which subsumes both the middle voice and the passive voice
 10: MiddleVoice : 
			A verb that appears active but expresses a passive action may be called middle voice, e.g. 
			'The chicken cooked in the oven'. In Greek the middle voice is often reflexive expressing a
			causative reading or that the action is performed for one's own benefit.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#middleVoice)
		
 11: NonpromotionalInverseVoice : 
			Involves demotion of the non-topical obviate-agent from subjecthood. (Givon 1994:24)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NonpromotionalInverse)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 12: PassiveVoice : 
			When the subject is the patient, target or undergoer of the action, 
			it is said to be in the passive voice. 
			(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_voice  17.11.06)
			
			When the subject is the agent or actor of the verb, the verb is said 
			to be in the active voice. When the subject is the patient, target or
			undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the passive voice.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#passiveVoice)
			
			Passive is often not clearly distinguished from Inverse: According to Givón (1988),
			Inverse is characterized by obligatory realization of the suppressed agent,
			whereas the realization of the agent in a passive construction is optional 
			(or impossible).
			This restrictive definition of passive does, however, conflict with the 
			use of the term "passive" for European languages. Then, English and German 
			"Passive" would be Inverses. Therefore, Inverse is a subconcept of Passive here.
			Givón's original Passive is NonInversePassive.
		
 13: PragmaticInverseVoice : 
			If the agent is more topical than the patient, the direct-active clause 
			is used.  If norm is reversed and the patient is more topical, the inverse 
			clause is used. (Givon 1994:23)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PragmaticInverse)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 14: PromotionalInverseVoice : 
			Involves promotion of the topical proximate-patient to subjecthood. (Givon 1994:24)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PromotionalInverse)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 15: PseudopassiveVoice : voice in a specify passive construction (different from the regular passive) where the patient is the syntactic subject and agent is the syntactic object
 16: ReferentialVoice : 
			entails assignment of the absolutive to certain kinds of arguments other 
			than the logical subjects (A) and objects (P), including the dative, 
			benefactive, malefactive, and possessor.  (Klaiman 1991:239)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ReferentialVoice)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 17: ReflexiveVoice : 
			The reflexive voice is a grammatical voice in which the subject is both the agent and the patient or recipient.
			(http://languagelink.let.uu.nl/tds/onto/LinguisticOntology.owl#reflexiveVoice)
		
 18: SemanticInverseVoice : 
			If the agent outranks the patient on the relevant generic topic hierarchy, 
			the direct-active clause is used.  If the relevant norm is reversed and the 
			patient outranks the agent on the relevant hierarchy, the inverse clause is 
			used. (Givon 1994:23)
			(http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/SemanticInverse)
		^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string
 19: VoiceNoun : 
                            noun of a voice
                                (http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2253)
