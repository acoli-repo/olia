# Semantics extension for OLiA

OLiA covers semantics to the extent that it is covered in syntactically annotated corpora (semantic roles, named entities).

For designated semantic annotations (e.g., AMR or SRL annotations), very different conceptualizations of data structures and labels have been developed, but without a clear consensus towards any of them. The topic is currently pursued in the context of the [W3C Community Group Ontology-Lexica (OntoLex)](https://github.com/ontolex/synsem). We expect that when these specifications converge, OLiA (either directly or via Lexinfo) will be integrated and extrended accordingly. However, this is being pursued in an OntoLex repository, not here.

However, we maintain a number of resources originally planned for integration with OLiA. Originally, these were mirrors of publicly available data, it seems, however, that the original host sites are down, so that the content provided here is intended for future reference, but not for active development.
