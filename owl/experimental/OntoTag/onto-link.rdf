    >I prefer to model main ("lexical", "full") verbs as being non-auxiliaries, but there are some reasons to think about it more deeply, e.g. German "brauchen" which is usually regarded a lexical verb which is about to be grammaticized as a modal verb, hence it shows both full ("er braucht") and reduced ("er brauch") inflection. Currently, this cannot be modelled, so I will probably re-introduce the class "LexicalVerb". Probably not "main verb", because it sounds too miuch likre "main predicate" which is a function of the verb within a clause. 
I am not sure whether I understand the copular/predicative distinction correctly. What I have is a copula, but this is only a specific use of English "to be". (the one which is the "empty" one in semantic analysis, e.g. "He is old." In many languages, unrealized by default, e.g. Russian "On staryj." In Russian, sometimes written by "-": "On - staryj.") In English and German, the copula is formally identical to (and tagged like) the auxilliary (which is also semantically empty), hence, I've included it under auxilliary.</rdfs:comment>

Your pronoun/determiner distinction is modelled at the leaf nodes, mine is reversed (following the sequence of features in EAGLES). However, I am not confident with my modelling yet and probably re-arrange anything into three types of classes which may intersect: the discourse function (e.g. demonstrative), the syntactic function (i.e. determiner vs. non-determiner) and the semantic function (i.e. pronominal vs. non-pronominal)</rdfs:comment>

    >What do you do with Quantifiers, e.g. "many". In EAGLES, they are not explicitly mentioned, in the EAGLES-conformant tag set for English, their modelled as indefinite determiners. This use , however, does not cover their real uses at least in German, where they can also be pronominal ("Ich habe viele gesehen."), nominal ("Die wenigen, die da standen, warteten lange.") or adverbial ("Hast du die alle gezählt ?" [this also has a nominal reading]). In English, this usually requires additions ("all *of them*" etc.), but in other languages, it doesn't, so I prefer to establish a top-level category quantifier defined according to its semantic function which may intersect with other word classes according to their syntactic (etc.) characteristics. Numerals follow the same pattern, quantifiers may be regarded as numerals (as assumed in the Russian tag set) or numerals may be regarded as quantifiers (as in Gold).

    >I restrict myself to the linguistic part and suggest that, whenever a direct mapping or merging of our ontologies comes into reach, the typographic part is separated from the linguistic part, e.g. in a separate sub-ontology. In our approach, there is no representation of typography.
Abstracting from typographic issues, I assign equivalence wherever possible. Note that, however, in the Reference Model there are no constraints on disjointness and exhaustivity. I just realized that equivalence is only possible if it has not assigned before, hence read "subClassOf" as "equivalence" unless there is something different in the comments.</rdfs:comment>

    >My modelling deviates from EAGLES as articles are defined as determiners. This is due to my definition of determiners as elements which fulfill a certain syntactic function. This function, i.e. to convert a nominal into an NP (DP), is common to determiners and articles (in the EAGLES sense). I guess, the EAGLES grouping ((Pronoun Determiner) Article) instead of (Pronoun (Determiner Article)) reflects language-specific surface ambiguity only and has no theoretical status.</rdfs:comment>

    >I've interpreted the EAGLES comment mentioning "negative particles" in that I interpreted "Unique" always as non-theoretical term of (a narrow definition of) "Particle". However, Unassigned (i.e. not recognized by the tagger) is something different and I explicitly excluded it from the ontology which deals with properly analyzed categories only.</rdfs:comment>

    >this is consistent with my modelling in that I recommend to define subclasses of numeral/quantifier by intersections with other word classes. however, as I try to keep tjhe reference model as minimal as possible, I would introduce this class only if it is needed, i.e. it has a more specific function than the sheer intersection between numeral and pronoun/determiner</rdfs:comment>
