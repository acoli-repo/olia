            >Annotation Model for the Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project
&lt;br/&gt;
The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world&#39;s languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The specification of the schema is described here and in Sylak-Glassman (2016). (http://unimorph.org)
&lt;br/&gt;
Unless marked otherwise, all comments are drawn from Sylak-Glassman (2016). At present, the UniMorph Schema accounts for inflectional morphology only, not derivational morphology.
&lt;br/&gt;
The UniMorph Schema is intended to capture the full range of meaning that can be expressed by inflectional morphology across the world&#39;s languages. As instantiated in this document, the schema contains 23 dimensions of meaning and over 240 features. The UniMorph Schema provides a way to annotate very rich, fine-grained representations of the meaning encoded in fully inflected word forms, thereby allowing HLT applications to extract meaning from inflectional morphology across languages with strong confidence that the inflectional categories are semantically equivalent. ... The UniMorph Schema is designed to achieve extremely broad cross-linguistic coverage, and has proven useful in universalizing inflected forms in over 350 languages on Wiktionary (Sylak-Glassman et al. 2015b,a). However, it is a work-in-progress, and would benefit from user input, especially in case any other dimensions or features should be included. (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.58f.)

            >Note that descriptions are not necessarily literal quotes from Sylak-Glasman, but have been partially simplified and abbreviated. In particular, argumentative sections have been removed, as well as many examples and diagrams. The latter, however, are partially encoded in the structure of the ontology. Due to limitations of UTF-8 export from PDF documents, examples with non-ASCII characters had to be removed. For cyrillic, the original (cyrillic) spelling has been partially restored. 
&lt;br/&gt;
Also note that I followed Sylak-Glassman in modeling features as individuals (primitive values) rather than classes wherever possible. However, where he describes a hierarchical organization (e.g., animacy, aktionsart) or mentions that one feature is a specialization of another (e.g., aspect), classes were created to capture these definitions.
&lt;br/&gt;
Wrt. naming conventions for classes, the original names have been adopted wherever possible. If a concept name X cannot be easily used in a phrase like &quot;x is a X&quot; without causing confusion, it has been adjusted to XFeature. For example, &quot;Deixis&quot; and &quot;Reference Point&quot; have been renamed to &quot;DeixisFeature&quot; and &quot;ReferencePointFeature&quot;, because &quot;proximate is a Deixis&quot; or &quot;phoric is a Reference&quot; would be unnatural.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
	Brown and Levinson (1987:276) define the speaker-addressee axis as the &quot;direct encoding[...] of the speaker-addressee relationship, independent of the referential content of the utterance&quot; (emphasis JCS). Levinson (1983:90) describes a speaker-addressee honorific system by saying that &quot;... in many languages (notably the S. E. Asian languages, including Korean, Japanese and Javanese) it is possible to say some sentence glossing as `The soup is hot&#39; and by the choice of a linguistic alternate (e.g. for `soup&#39;) encode respect to the addressee without referring to him, in which case we have an addressee honorific system.&quot; Japanese teineigo is an example of an addressee honorific system. Javanese (Austronesian) has an addressee honorific system containing a high-level form called krama and a form between that and common speech that contains fewer lexical items and is called madya (Wenger 1982:71). Addressee honorific systems are less common than referent honorific systems (Wenger 1982) ...

The term aktionsart (plural aktionsarten; capitalization adapted to English) was originally used by Agrell (1908) to refer to &quot;secondary modifications of basic verb meanings by means of affixes,&quot; as in German erbl&#195;&#188;hen `to start flowering&#39; from bl&#195;&#188;hen `to flower&#39; (Klein 1994:17).

            >Nichols (1986) discusses a fundamental distinction between head-marking languages, which mark relations between a head and dependent on the head, and dependent-marking languages, which mark such relations on the dependent. Familiar European languages are dependent-marking in that nominal case is marked on the noun itself. However, languages such as Abkhaz (Chirikba 2003) and Choctaw (Davies 1986) are head-marking, and can mark four or five distinct nominal arguments, respectively, on a verb. For example, Abkhaz can mark a subject (ergative), object (absolutive), indirect dative object, and indirect beneficiary object simultaneously on a single verb ...
&lt;br/&gt;
	Following Kibrik (2012), the arguments marked by a verb are labeled here using case terminology, rather than, for example, grammatical terminology such as &quot;subject, direct object, indirect object.&quot; This is especially appropriate given that head-marking languages can also show patterns similar to so-called `quirky case&#39; in which verbs, especially psych verbs, trigger agreement patterns in which the subject is not marked in the same way as subjects for other verbs. This shows that purely formal considerations also shape the pattern, rather than just grammatical or even semantic relations, even though these also play a role. ...
	
	To capture arguments marked on the verb in head-marking languages, the UniMorph Schema employs templatic features which all begin with arg-, to signify that a verb is marking an argument, and continue with shorthand features for case, person, number, and gender.

	to define tense and aspect categories. 
	Topic Time (TT) and Situation Time (TSit) are conceived as spans while Time of Utterance (TU) is a single point. 
	By defining tense and aspect categories solely in terms of the ordering of these spans and TU, tense and aspect categories can be defined independent of the language under analysis in a way that facilitates cross-linguistic comparison. 
&lt;br/&gt;
	TU is the time at which a speaker makes an utterance, and topic time (TT) is the time about which the speaker is making a claim about the action of the verb. Situation time (TSit) is the time in which the state of affairs described by the verb held true.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Aspect indicates the relationship between the time for which a claim is made (TT) and the time for which a situation actually held true (TSit). 
&lt;br/&gt;
	The core aspects that can be defined by relating TSit and TT are: imperfective, perfective, perfect, progressive, and prospective. The habitual and iterative aspects are also defined this way, but require more than one TSit.

Telic verbs have a well-defined terminal point at which an action naturally terminates with a result Comrie (1976a:44-45). A test for telicity introduced by Klein (1974:106-107) is whether an action, when interrupted, can be felicitously described as having occurred. For example, if someone is drowning and they are interrupted, one cannot say &quot;someone drowned.&quot; In contrast, if someone is playing and is interrupted, one can felicitously say &quot;someone played.&quot; These examples, quoted in Comrie (1976a:45), illustrate the telicity of &quot;drown&quot; and the atelicity of &quot;play.&quot; The action of drowning naturally terminates and yields a result whereas the action of playing need not ever necessarily terminate.

Modern Fula (Fulani) &quot;has three voices [active, middle, passive], each associated with a distinct inflectional paradigm of the verb&quot; and &quot;about a fifth of the lexical verbs [...] can inflect in all three&quot; (Klaiman 1991:26).

These systems are typically termed &quot;taboo speech, avoidance language,&quot; or &quot;court language.&quot; ...
	
	The maximal attested number of levels within a bystander honorific system is five in Pohnpeian (Keating and Duranti 2006:151-152). These five levels include: 
	1) a low level, which the speaker uses in the presence of only those having a low status; 
	2) a common level which is unmarked for status; 
	3) a general high status that can be used specifically in the presence of the secondary chief and secondary chieftess; 
	4) a high status form for use in the presence of the (primary) chieftess; and finally, 
	5) a high status form specifically for use in the presence of the (primary) chief.

&lt;br/&gt;
	More technically, &quot;case is a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their heads&quot; (Blake 2001:1). 
	This encompasses two uses of the term `case&#39;: 
	1) the marking of argument structure by the syntax at a deep level (such as logical form, LF), and 
	2) the overt morphological marking of argument structure, spatial relations, and psychological attitudes at the surface level. 
	
	For our purposes, only this second type of `case&#39; is relevant. 
	
	The types of overt case that are encountered in the world&#39;s languages can be divided into three types: 
	1) core case*, 
	2) non-core non-local cases, and 
	3) local case** (following the classification of Blake 2001).
	
	* Core cases indicate the roles of NPs with respect to syntactic alignment,
	** Local cases have been shown to have an internal organization that is consistent across languages (Radkevich 2010).

            >Core case is also known as `non-local,&#39; `nuclear,&#39; or `grammatical&#39; case (Blake 2001:119; Comrie and Polinsky 1998:97) and includes a limited set of cases that are used to indicate the role of a syntactic argument as subject, object, or indirect object. The types of core cases vary according to the syntactic alignment that a given language uses and can be defined in terms of three &quot;metaarguments,&quot; S, A, and P.
	
	S is the subject of an intransitive (1-argument) verb. 
	A is the subject of a transitive (2-argument) or ditransitive (3-argument) verb. 
	P is the direct object of a transitive or ditransitive verb.
	
	S, A, and P are all abbreviations from the first letters of the terms `subject,&#39; `agent,&#39; and `patient,&#39; respectively. Indirect objects are commonly marked with the dative case and are typically not considered core arguments.
	
	The ways in which languages map morphological cases to the meta-arguments S, A, and P are collectively called syntactic alignment systems. 
	
	In a language with nominative-accusative alignment, the nominative case is used for nouns that function as S or A and accusative is used for nouns that function as P (Blake 2001:119-121). 
	
	In an ergative-absolutive language, the ergative case is used for nouns that function as A only while absolutive case is used to mark nouns that function as S or P (122-125). 
	
	A few languages have been claimed to possess a full, tripartite distinction between S, A, and P. These languages include Wangkumara (Breen 1976 via Blake 2001:126; Pama-Nyungan) and Yazgulyam (Edel&#39;man 1966:37, 167, 185, Payne 1981:176 via Bickel and Nichols 2009; Pamir, Indo-Iranian).

	Another kind of syntactic alignment, which cannot be described solely in terms of S, A, and P, is the direct-inverse system, which is described under the section on grammatical voice systems in Sylak-Glasman 2016, p. 56. These kinds of systems, which occur for example in Plains Cree, can overtly mark direct and inverse &quot;case&quot; on a noun. Nouns are also sometimes marked as `antipassive&#39; (ANTIP). This term and concept are discussed in the section on voice.

            >Features relevant to third-person and demonstrative pronouns (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.24)
&lt;br/&gt;
	The referent of pronouns is dependent on the context of the utterance, as is the referent of words like here, this, that, these, those. This quality of context-dependency is called deixis, and words are sometimes systematically contrasted in terms of their deictic properties.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Demonstrative pronouns are deictic words which encode a variety of distinctions in meaning that specify the relationship between the speaker or addressee and the person or thing referred to by the pronoun, and these distinctions are relevant for determining the referent of the demonstrative.
	For example, the difference between `this&#39; and `that&#39; in English can be understood as a distinction in distance. (&quot;Distance&quot; here should be understood in a very broad sense, since the English demonstratives `this&#39; and `that&#39; can be used to express spatial, temporal, or even psychological/social distance.) 
	`This&#39; is used to describe something closer to the speaker and `that&#39; is used for something farther away. ... [R]eference point, visibility, and verticality are also relevant deictic properties.

            >Both telic and atelic (atel) situations can be divided into punctual (pct) and durative (dur) events (Comrie 1976a:41-44). To illustrate the distinction, compare two atelic verbs, &quot;sneeze&quot; and &quot;run.&quot; One can run for an hour, and for that whole time the running is uninterrupted. There
are not small points in time where the action of running has ceased. However, if one says that someone sneezed for an hour, the interpretation is that multiple events necessarily had to occur, and that there were small breaks between those events in which the event was not occurring. &quot;Run&quot; is therefore durative because its action can extend over a time span. &quot;Sneeze&quot; is punctual because, lexically, it has no duration: It is a single event that takes place for an instant and the action cannot be understood as extending over a time span. Forcibly extending a punctual action over a time span, for example by specifically stating a duration, forces a repetitive interpretation.

            >Despite the diffculty of defining finiteness in a universal way along semantic or syntactic lines, the notion of finiteness remains cross-linguistically useful and is crucial for differentiating infinitives from other verb forms. For the purpose of this schema, verb forms that take the full extent of tense, aspect, and mood (TAM) marking in a language that can be used as predicates can be considered finite, while verbally-derived parts of speech such as masdars (verbal nouns), participles (verbal adjectives), and converbs (verbal adverbs) are considered nonfinite (Haspelmath 1995:4-7). The finiteness feature in the schema presented here is therefore partially redundant with the part of speech features: Masdars, participles, and converbs are always nonfinite while plain verbs may be finite or nonfinite. An example of a plain verb with the feature nonfinite (NFIN) is the infinitive in languages such as Spanish, Russian, and English.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Although Koptjevskaja-Tamm (1993:29) echoes the opinion of Haspelmath (1995:5) and other linguists in writing that &quot;[t]he notion of finiteness is far from being well-defined,&quot; it is nevertheless a valuable means of distinguishing a small set of cross-linguistically common verb forms with recurring characteristics. One view is that a verbal form is finite if it takes a subject in nominative, ergative, or absolutive case and if it can take on inflectional features, such as number and gender, based on another syntactic argument (subject or object; Cowper 2002). Another view is that finite verb forms are those which can function as the predicate of independent clauses while nonfinite verb forms are always (morpho-)syntactically dependent (Koptjevskaja-Tamm 1993:29). The notion of finiteness appears to be best viewed as a language-specific constellation of syntactic properties.

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en"
            >Gender is a grammatical category that includes both gender, as conventionally known from European languages like Spanish, French, German, and Russian, as well as systems with more than three categories that are typically described as noun class systems. These include systems like that of the Nakh-Daghestanian languages of the Northeast Caucasus with two to eight gender categories, as well as more extensive systems, such as those of the Bantu languages, which can include up to around twenty distinct categories (Corbett 1991:24, 43-44).
&lt;br/&gt;
	Gender systems can be organized according to either natural gender (biological sex), formal gender, or a mix (Corbett 1991:1). Natural gender systems classify nouns according to transparent semantic criteria. In formal gender systems, however, there need not be any correlation between the gender category of a noun and any of the properties of the entity to which the noun refers. Gender in these systems may either be based on phonological properties or else is an unpredictable lexical property that must be memorized.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Within language families, gender categories and their assignment to nouns can overlap among languages enough to render the equation of gender categories appropriate. The gender features of this schema are therefore often tied to particular language families. This ensures that gender features have some generality, and do not proliferate as language-specific features. For example, the eight possible genders (or noun classes) of the Nakh-Daghestanian languages are labeled as NAKH1, NAKH2, NAKH3, NAKH4, and so on for languages like Tsova-Tush (Corbett 1991:24). Similarly, the Bantu noun classes are symbolized as BANTU1-23, which encompasses the whole range of noun classes that could have been inherited in any given Bantu language from proto-Bantu (Demuth 2000:270-272).
&lt;br/&gt;
	Other gender systems from other language families can be incorporated on this same model, with features of a similar format, namely a short abbreviation for the language family followed by the term used for the specific gender. The schema includes features for the masculine, feminine, and neuter distinction common in Indo-European languages.

            >[A] common non-local case is the genitive (GEN), which prototypically marks the possessor (e.g. John&#39;s/John in John&#39;s cat, in the cat of John, and in that cat of John&#39;s). Related to the genitive is the relative case (REL), which combines the &quot;A function and possessor function&quot; and occurs in &quot;a number of Caucasian languages and the Eskimo languages&quot;. The genitive case is also used in some languages to cover the uses of the partitive case (PRT), which marks the patient (P) of a verb as being only partly affected by the verb&#39;s action (e.g. some milk [but not all] in he drank some milk). The partitive case occurs as an independent case in Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, where it &quot;is used for the patient if it represents part of a whole or an indefinite quantity, if the action is incomplete, or if the polarity of the clause is negative&quot;. These uses of the partitive are captured by the genitive case in both Russian and French. Russian&#39;s &quot;genitive of negation&quot; (e.g. Russian njet molok-a `no milk-GEN&#39;) can also be thought of as connected to the senses of meanings conveyed using the partitive.

            >Information structure is a component of grammar that formally expresses &quot;the pragmatic structuring of a proposition in a discourse&quot; (Lambrecht 1994:5). More concretely, information structure directly encodes which parts of a proposition are presented as new information for the addressee and which are not (5-6). (Lambrecht (1994:5) formally defines information structure as the &quot;component of sentence grammar in which propositions as conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts.&quot;)
	
	Languages may distinguish the topic (TOP) and the focus (FOC) of a sentence through overt morphology. The topic can broadly be seen as signaling what the sentence is about. Lambrecht (1994:131) defines the topic more specifically as &quot;expressing information which is relevant to [a referent in the proposition] and which increases the addressee&#39;s knowledge of this referent.&quot; The focus can broadly be understood as signaling information that is not presupposed by the addressee (213). This information forms the core of the proposition&#39;s assertion, and typically includes the part of the proposition that is unpredictable or new to the listener (ibid.). Lambrecht (1994:213) formally defines focus as &quot;[t]he semantic component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition.&quot;
	
	While most studies on information structure distinguish multiple types of topic and focus (including Lambrecht 1994) that can be distinguished via prosody or syntax, no language appears to make distinctions via overt affixal morphology to a finer degree than topic vs. focus vs. unmarked. Lambrecht (1994:119) explains the lack of any formal topic marking in many languages, or of more fine-grained topic marking in languages which do formally mark it, as a result of the difficulty of strictly limiting the topic to any particular element in a proposition.

            >While most inflectional variation can be tied to regular semantic differences, some inflectional variation is free or subject to not-strictly-semantic conditioning factors. For example, the imperfect tense of the subjunctive mood in Spanish can be realized with an inflection that includes either -ra- or -se-. Although the choice of forms is not entirely free, the factors that condition the choice are not tied to meaning captured by inflection. That is, the forms cannot be differentiated by a meaning captured by a feature of this schema. ...
&lt;br/&gt;
	To capture these distinctions in features within the schema, templatic features with the base LGSPEC followed by an integer (e.g. LGSPEC1) are used. These features have different interpretations in each language, and no mapping should be assumed between the LGSPEC features and any other features across languages. This approach avoids the problem of feature proliferation and possible conflict that results if the form of the feature is closely tied to the realization in a particular language.

            >Grammatical mood is the morphological marking of modality on a verb. &quot;Modality is concerned with the status [from the speaker&#39;s point of view; JCS] of the proposition that describes the event&quot; (Palmer 2001:1), and can be expressed either by affixal morphology or through periphrastic/phrasal constructions. ...
	Most commonly, languages split mood into two superordinate categories, either indicative vs. subjunctive or realis vs. irrealis (Palmer 2001:3-5). While there is some distinction in the modalities that fall under the categories within these two types of oppositions, these two sets of superordinate categories can be reduced to an underlying opposition between Realis and Irrealis. ...

	Similar to the subjunctive/irrealis is the category found in Australian languages called the purposive. The purposive primarily &quot;expresses obligation (and epistemic necessity) in main clauses,&quot; and can also be used in that context in Dyirbal &quot;to suggest a result from an unknown cause&quot; (Palmer 2001:83). ... Palmer (ibid.) notes that &quot;these functions of the `purposive&#39; are very like those of the subjunctive in Latin, which can also be used for purpose, result and for indirect commands.&quot; Given this information, the non-purposive (AUNPRP) vs. purposive (AUPRP) opposition can be viewed as on par with the realis vs. irrealis and indicative vs. subjunctive oppositions.
	
	These superordinate categories of modality are not only frequently encountered in language descriptions, their uses often overlap substantially across languages to the point that equating the categories across languages can be useful.

	The number categories found on nouns include singular, plural, dual, trial, paucal, greater paucal, greater plural, and inverse marking (Corbett 2000). ...
	On verbs, Amele (Papuan) encodes singular, dual, and plural, and Kiowa (Kiowan-Tanoan) (Corbett 2000:136-137, 159-161) encodes singular, dual, and inverse. Meriam (Meriam Mir; Trans-Fly; Torres Strait Islands) and Sursurunga add another number by marking singular, dual, paucal, and plural on verbs (Corbett 2000; Piper 1989:26-30). Kiwai also encodes four categories of number on verbs, but marks the singular, dual, trial, and plural (255).

	It is the cross-product of the concepts of object, property, and action with the functions of reference, modification, and predication. This conceptual space provides definitions for the following crosslinguistically common parts of speech, which are all captured by features in the UniMorph Schema: Nouns (N), adpositions (ADP), adjectives (ADJ), verbs (V), masdars (V.MSDR), participles (V.PTCP), converbs (V.CVB), and adverbs (ADV).

	Following the practice of the Universal Dependencies Project (Choi et al. 2015), numerals, particles, and interjections are also treated as separate parts of speech. Numerals include cardinal numerals. Where appropriate, ordinal numerals (first, second, etc.) often behave as adjectives and should be classified as such. Particles include isolated, generally mono- or bisyllabic, words with varying grammatical and discursive meanings. Japanese is well-known for having a large number of particles, which include, among other kinds, question particles such as ne and kasira as well as particles emphasizing assertion, such as yo, zo, and ze (Tsujimura 2007:435-436). Interjections include words such as English ouch, oof, etc., which are expressive, but have neither grammatical nor lexical meaning.

            >While languages often use separate possessive adjectives (such as my, your, his, her, our, and their in English) to mark possession, some languages, such as Turkish and certain Quechua languages, use overt affixal morphology to mark the possessor directly on the possessed noun. ...
&lt;br/&gt;
	Huallaga Quechua marks possession through overt affixal morphology that distinguishes the possessor&#39;s person and clusivity, yielding distinctions between morphemes with the meaning my, your, his/her/its, our (inclusive) and our (exclusive) (Weber 1989:54-55). ... Turkish marks possession in a similar way, distinguishing the possessor&#39;s person, number (for first and second person), and politeness, but not clusivity as in Quechua. ... Like Turkish and Huallaga Quechua, Arabic distinguishes possessive suffixes by the person and number of the possessor, but adds dual to the number distinctions made among possessors. Arabic possessive suffixes are also distinguished by the gender of the possessor (Ryding 2005:301). ...
&lt;br/&gt;
	Features that mark characteristics of the possessor are composed according to a template, which begins with pss- to mark `possessed,&#39; followed by a single number to mark the person of the possessor, a single letter to mark the number of the possessor, and an indication of gender, clusivity, or politeness. If a language were to mark possession by, for example, another kind of gender other than masculine or feminine (e.g. neuter), features could easily be created using this template (e.g. in this case, PSS3SN for a third person singular neuter possessive with the meaning of English its).
&lt;br/&gt;
	In addition to features marking characteristics of the possessor, features indicating the type of possession itself are necessary. Some languages distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession. An example of this contrast is the difference in the type of possession involved in `my house&#39; vs. `my back,&#39; in which the first type of possession is possession of property whose ownership can change while the second indicates inherent ownership.

            >[In] Pragmatic voice ... &quot;alternations in verbal marking signal the variable assignment to sentential arguments of some special pragmatic status or salience&quot; (Klaiman 1991:31-32). ...
	
	Pragmatic voice systems include what have been called direct-inverse systems, which are common in North American languages, as well as complex voicing systems in Austronesian languages (so-called `Austronesian voice&#39;). In languages that possess direct-inverse systems, a salience hierarchy exists such that, as a hypothetical example, first person is higher (more &quot;salient&quot;) than second person, which is higher than third person, and all these human pronouns are higher than any non-human animate nouns (or pronouns referring to them), and all these in turn are higher than inanimate nouns or pronouns, yielding the hierarchy: 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; non-human animate &gt; inanimate. When the argument of the verb that is the most `salient&#39; in the sentence functions as the subject, the verb is either morphologically unmarked or is marked with a morpheme indicating direct voice (e.g. -a: in Plains Cree; Klaiman 1992:230). When the argument of the verb that is lower in the hierarchy functions as the subject, it is marked with a morpheme indicating inverse voice (e.g. -iko in Plains Cree; ibid.).
	
	In general, pragmatic voice marking affects the prominence of nominals associated with specific semantic roles or with positions on a salience hierarchy. One striking example of this is the alignment system commonly found in Austronesian languages, particularly those of the Philippines, such as Tagalog, Cebuano, and Ilocano. In the pragmatic voice system of Cebuano, a different voice is used to focus nouns occupying four semantic roles, agent (A), goal (G), directional (D), and instrumental (I) (Klaiman 1991:247). ...
	
	Here, a voice marker that is tied to the semantic role of the focused noun is used on the verb and the overt marker of the semantic role on the focused noun is replaced by a marker that indicates both its semantic role and its status as focused. The Austronesian language that makes the most distinctions in semantic role marking in its voice system is Iloko (Ilocano). The semantic roles it marks are given dedicated features in the UniMorph Schema since they are used by other Austronesian languages. Those roles are: Agent (AGFOC), patient (PFOC), location (LFOC), beneficiary (BFOC), accompanier (ACFOC), instrument (IFOC), and conveyed (CFOC; either by actual motion or in a linguistic sense, as by a speech act) (Rubino 2005:336-338).

            >Both telic and atelic (atel) situations can be divided into punctual (pct) and durative (dur) events (Comrie 1976a:41-44). To illustrate the distinction, compare two atelic verbs, &quot;sneeze&quot; and &quot;run.&quot; One can run for an hour, and for that whole time the running is uninterrupted. There
are not small points in time where the action of running has ceased. However, if one says that someone sneezed for an hour, the interpretation is that multiple events necessarily had to occur, and that there were small breaks between those events in which the event was not occurring. &quot;Run&quot; is therefore durative because its action can extend over a time span. &quot;Sneeze&quot; is punctual because, lexically, it has no duration: It is a single event that takes place for an instant and the action cannot be understood as extending over a time span. Forcibly extending a punctual action over a time span, for example by specifically stating a duration, forces a repetitive interpretation.

            >[T]he reference point for determining the relationship of the speaker, addressee, and referent of the pronoun (...) often overlaps with distance distinctions, but is sometimes explicitly separated. 
	The three primary features for the reference point feature are speaker as reference point (REF1), addressee as reference point (REF2), and a reference point not related to either speaker or addressee (distal; DIST). 
&lt;br/&gt;
	Another essential feature is what has been called the &quot;anaphoric&quot; feature, which designates a pronoun as obligatorily referring to a referent that occurs in the discourse. Strictly speaking, anaphoric pronouns must refer to something that has previously occurred in discourse while a cataphoric pronoun would obligatorily refer to something that comes after it in the discourse. Because the pronouns of Lak (Nakh-Daghestanian; Bhat 2004:132-133, Friedman 2006:304) and Sinhalese (Indo-European; Gair 2003:782-783) appear not to contrast specific anaphoric and cataphoric pronouns, the feature that is used to indicate obligatory anaphoric or cataphoric reference is simply called phoric (PHOR).

	The best known example of speaker-referent honorific morphology is the Indo-European T/V pronoun distinction, manifesting as tu/vous in French, tu/voi in Italian, ty/vy in Russian, and so on. Another example of this kind of system appears to be Yemsa (Omotic; Corbett 2012), which has distinct second and third person honorific pronominal forms with corresponding marking of these distinctions on verbs via agreement.

&lt;br/&gt;
Comrie (1976a:48-50) defines stative verbs as those whose action will continue (or continue to hold true) without any additional effort being applied. Moreover, a stative action usually continues without any internal change in the type of action that is occurring. For example, in &quot;John knows Chris,&quot; no effort is required on John&#39;s part to continue to know someone and there is no internal dynamic to the action of knowing. However, in &quot;John is building a shed,&quot; continued effort is required on John&#39;s part to continue building and the action of building involves different phases that progress to an endpoint.

            >Switch-reference is a type of anaphoric linkage that disambiguates the reference of subjects and other NPs across clauses (Stirling 1993:1). Although switch-reference has a functional basis, disambiguating the reference of subjects and other NPs, it is a fully grammaticalized phenomenon and is used in the languages in which it occurs even when the reference of subjects or other NPs is already fully disambiguated by other means. ... 
&lt;br/&gt;
	Switch-reference (SR) marking is concentrated in languages of North America (notably in the Southwest, Great Basin, and coastal Northern California), Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Bantu languages of Africa (Stirling 1993:5). It also occurs in languages of South America, and switch-reference-like phenomena have been identified in the Northeast Caucasus (Nichols 1983). 
&lt;br/&gt;
	A typical and basic distinction in SR systems is between same subject, SS, and different subject, DS. This type of system occurs in Usan (Papuan; Stirling 1993:4,  citing Haiman and Munro 1983:xi(3,4)), Imbabura Quichua (Cohen 2013:55-56), and Mojave (Yuman; Munro 1980), to name a few. ...

&lt;br/&gt;
Telic verbs have a well-defined terminal point at which an action naturally terminates with a result Comrie (1976a:44-45). A test for telicity introduced by Klein (1974:106-107) is whether an action, when interrupted, can be felicitously described as having occurred. For example, if someone is drowning and they are interrupted, one cannot say &quot;someone drowned.&quot; In contrast, if someone is playing and is interrupted, one can felicitously say &quot;someone played.&quot; These examples, quoted in Comrie (1976a:45), illustrate the telicity of &quot;drown&quot; and the atelicity of &quot;play.&quot; The action of drowning naturally terminates and yields a result whereas the action of playing need not ever necessarily terminate.

            >Tense and aspect are defined according to the framework in Klein (1994, 1995), which builds on Reichenbach (1947) ...
&lt;br/&gt;
	Tense is the relationship of the time of utterance (TU) to the topic time (TT). For example, in the sentence, &quot;The book was lying on the table,&quot; the speaker is making a claim about a time period (TT) that occurred prior to the time of utterance (TU). Past tense indicates that the time for which the claim is meant to be true, TT, occurred before TU. Present tense indicates that the situation holds true during the time of utterance. Future tense indicates that at some point after the time of utterance, a situation will hold true. ...
	
	Although past, present, and future are the core tense relationships that can be establishing by the relative positioning of TU and TT, languages use morphological marking to indicate the temporal distance between TU and TT, leading to distinctions like recent vs. remote past. A survey of such systems in Comrie (1985) reveals that while the most common split is a two-way split in the past tense between events that happened on the same day (hodiernal, from Latin hodie `today&#39;; 87) from those that did not, languages can make up to six such temporal distinctions. ... Because the levels of temporal distance can be symmetrical, terms for these levels are meant to apply to both past and future, such that a hodiernal past would be indicated as PST+HOD and a future hodiernal would be FUT+HOD. These are preliminary categories since it may be better to encode some of the temporal distinctions using a feature-like analysis. For example, it may be possible to encode some of the finer distinctions in Upper Chinookan with combinations of temporal distance features. Preliminarily, I propose that Upper Chinookan&#39;s `last week&#39; distinction could be PST+1DAY+RCT while `from a week to a year ago&#39; would be simply PST+RCT and similarly the `from 1-10 years ago&#39; level may be PST+RCT+RMT while the truly remote past would be simply PST+RMT.

	The valency of a verb is often a lexical property, but both the valency and the relationship between arguments that are already present can be changed by specific morphology in many languages.

            >Verbs, like nouns, are a basic part of speech in that they need not co-occur with any other part of speech and are not a subclass of any other part of speech. Like nouns, it has been claimed that verbs are present in every human language (Baker 2003). Their typical function is as predicates which describe an action.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Verbs can also form the basis for productively deriving three parts of speech, namely participles, masdars, and converbs, that each behave similarly to adjectives, nouns, and adverbs, respectively. While these three parts of speech could be subsumed within the part of speech that they behave as (i.e. adjectives, nominals, and adverbs), the fact that they are derived from verbs typically entails other syntactic properties or restrictions that do not apply to non-derived exemplars of the part of speech they behave as. For example, these derived forms are often still able to govern nouns as direct objects (...), and these properties motivate treating them as a class distinct from both the part of speech from which they are derived (verbs) and those which they resemble most strongly from a functional perspective.

            >[T]hird person and demonstrative pronouns can also encode the vertical spatial relationship between the speaker and referent. Extending on a level plane from the speaker&#39;s view, a referent can either be above that plane (ABV), below it (BEL), or at the same level (EVEN) (Schulze 2003:297-300). In addition to Khasi, many of the Nakh-Daghestanian (Northeast Caucasian) languages make verticality distinctions in their demonstrative pronouns. 
&lt;br/&gt;
	However, not all Nakh-Daghestanian languages possess this distinction, and in some, the original system has been subjected to restructuring. For example, in Lak, the former remote, &quot;below&quot; demonstrative pronoun ga has become an unmarked remote while the former unmarked demonstrative pronoun ta has come to designate something at the same level (Friedman 2006:304).

For example, the alternation between an active sentence he broke the window versus its passive equivalent the window was broken changes the subject of the sentence, a core nominal, from he to the window and omits the semantic agent he in the passive variant.

            >Adjectives are the prototypical modifiers of nouns. Used attributively, they must co-occur with a noun, and they often agree with features controlled by that noun. Even when used predicatively, adjectives can still be subject to the features that their head noun controls (e.g. across a copula). For example, adjectives in Russian must agree in number, gender, and case with their head noun. The phenomenon of substantivization represents a cross-linguistic exception to the generalization that adjectives must co-occur with nouns. In cases of substantivization, an adjective functions like a noun. For example, the adjective poor is substantivized in the English sentence `the poor face significant disadvantages&#39;. The adjective is allowed to directly take a definite article and to control number features (here, plural). (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.37)</rdfs:comment>

            >Other systems are larger by virtue of allowing coreference between subjects and NPs in other grammatical roles, such as direct and indirect object. For example, in Capanahua (Panoan), there are &quot;six DS suffixes, two of which imply the identity of the subject of the [morphologically] marked clause with the object of the controlling clause, and one of which implies the identity of the object of the marked clause with the subject of the controlling clause&quot; (Stirling 1993:25-26 citing Jacobsen 1967:257). Another system that has expanded switch-reference due to indexing subjects with non-subject NPs is attested in Warlpiri (Pama-Nyungan). Warlpiri has 4 overt SR markers that relate subjects to subjects, subjects to direct objects, and subjects to indirect objects (Stirling 1993:25). ...
	
	To capture systems like those in Warlpiri and Capanahua, it is necessary to have a schematic morpheme that relates the role of the NP in the controlling clause to that of the NP in the marked clause. This takes the form ControllingClauseNP_Relation_MarkedClauseNP (abbreviated CN_R_MN), where the roles of the NPs would be marked using case relations, such that same subject in a nominative-accusative language would be CNOM_S_MNOM, where S in the R slot stands for `same.&#39; Different subject marking might be CNOM_D_MNOM.

            >Equative case marks equality or similarity, glossed as `(as much) as s.o./sth, like s.o./sth&#39;. (Sylak-Glasman 2016, p.18)
&lt;br/&gt;
	[I]n Tsez and other languages ... the equative (EQTV) ... indicates the standard of comparison in statements of equality and can be translated &quot;(e.g. as much) as X&quot; (Comrie and Polinsky 1998:101-102). The equative case is used in this form in Ancash Quechua, where it is expressed with the suffix -naw (Cuzzolin and Lehmann 2004). Equative case is also used in some languages to capture a similative meaning &quot;like, resembling,&quot; and will be used as such here. (Sylak-Glasman 2016, p.17)
	
	Note that the equative case (EQTV) marks the standard of comparison in a comparative construction expressing equality while the equative marking (eqt) of an adjective indicates that the degree of the adjective itself expresses equality (Sylak-Glasman 2016, p.18)</rdfs:comment>

            >[E]quative constructions can ... be viewed as comparative constructions in which two entities are compared, but in which they exhibit a quality to an equal extent. The standard of comparison (as much as X) can be marked with a special equative case morpheme (eqtv) just as the adjective itself can be marked as conveying equality (eqt), as in Estonian and in Indonesian.
&lt;br/&gt;
	Note that this is distinct from the equative case, which marks the standard of comparison, e.g. as much as X.

Imperatives are direct commands or orders for the addressee to do some action while hortatives and jussives include more suggestive forms, such as &quot;let them X&quot; or &quot;let us X&quot; (where X is some action). These can all be understood as part of the same modal category, called here imperative-jussive, since imperatives are used with second person and jussives are complementarily used with first and third person (Palmer 2001:81, citing Lyons 1977).
	
	Related to imperative-jussives are prohibitives. While these are often morphologically distinct from positive imperative-jussives, they can be analyzed underlyingly either as negative imperative-jussives (&quot;Do not do X!&quot;), negative potentials (&quot;You cannot do X&quot;), or negative permissives (&quot;You may not do X&quot;).

            >In inverse number systems, nouns have a default number that indicates the number with which they are &quot;expected&quot; to occur, based on a language-internal understanding of their occurrence in the speakers&#39; surroundings. Variation exists across languages with inverse marking in this respect, but, for example, `child&#39; is by default singular while `tree&#39; is by default plural. Inverse number marking makes `child&#39; plural and `tree&#39; singular, effectively inverting the number value of noun. (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.34f.)

            >[S]ome West African languages have what have been called &quot;logophoric&quot; systems in which pronouns are explicitly coreferential with a pronoun in a previous clause. Here, the marking occurs on a noun rather than a verb, which is part of the reason these systems have not traditionally been considered switch-reference. This may be a trivial distinction, but other considerations favor treating logophoricity and switch-reference as separate phenomena. Languages that are logophoric often have syntactic and semantic restrictions on where logophoricity must be marked, e.g. in subordinate clauses which represent reported speech or are governed by the verb &quot;say&quot; (Stirling 1993:52-53). The obligatoriness of marking logophoricity also depends on person (53). In addition, there are unexpected co-reference patterns (ibid.). These can be seen in Gokana, which marks logophoricity on the verb and has thus been interpreted as a switch-reference language. ... Because these interpretations (especially 2.) are not expected in the case of standard same subject SR marking, logophoricity should be marked separately from standard same subject SR marking.

For example, the suffix -naya in Imbabura Quechua is called the &quot;desiderative&quot; and is translated as &quot;want(s) to&quot; (Cole 1982:181). In other languages, such as Limbu, a dedicated morpheme, e.g. -lo, is used to express wishes such as &quot;May it turn out well!&quot; (van Driem 1987:133). This modality is traditionally called optative. It is unclear whether the desiderative morpheme in Imbabura Quechua can be used this way and whether the optative in Limbu can be used in the first person singular (it can be used in all other persons and numbers, though; van Driem 1987:133-135).

However, pronouns are distinct from nouns by virtue of being inherently deictic (...) and by their syntactic and morphosyntactic properties. Pronouns refer to other nouns in the sentence (or in previous discourse), and unlike nouns, this reference is regulated by a variety of syntactic principles, including island constraints, crossover, and others. Pronouns may also exhibit different morphosyntactic properties from nouns. For example, pronouns are the only words in English which have morphologically marked case, e.g. she (nominative) from her (accusative/oblique) and who (nominative) from whom (accusative/oblique).

For example, names in English are typically definite by default, and can only take an article if they are coerced into the role of a common noun. ... A special construction such as apposition or name-giving is required to coerce a common noun into the role of a proper name (more precisely, an appellative, e.g. the metal, gold, commonly used by jewelers or this metal is called `gold&#39; ; Van Langendonck 2007:95, 171).

&lt;br/&gt;
	The prospective aspect (PROSP) is used when the topic time (TT) precedes the situation time (TSit). The prospective aspect is often confused with future tense since it refers to an action in the future. However, separating prospective aspect and future tense leads to a natural explanation for so-called `future perfect&#39; (which may actually be FUT;PRF) and so-called `future-in-the-past&#39; temporal categories. While the going to / gonna and be about to constructions are useful translations for the prospective aspect, they contain additional, separate connotations of intention for the going to construction and immediacy in the be about to construction.

Radkevich (2010:40-42) notes that `orientation morphemes&#39; with meanings much like those of demonstrative pronouns are directly affixed to nouns bearing local case morphology in Tabassaran, suggesting that in some languages, these domains of morphology may overlap. Moreover, the semantics of the distal/remote and proximate morphemes are the same for local cases and for demonstratives. Distal local case and remoteness on pronouns both indicate that the thing involved is distant from the speaker while proximate morphemes in both categories indicate the opposite.

The focused or otherwise more highly-ranked argument is marked as proximate and all others as obviative. This system is common in Algonquian languages, such as Plains Cree (Aissen 1997:706-709).

            >The simplest type of marking on the possessed noun marks no characteristics of the possessor, just the fact that the noun is possessed. The morphemes that mark possessed nouns in this way have been termed `anti-genitives&#39; (Andersen 1991) or `pertensives&#39; (Dixon 2010:268). They occur in N&#195;&#170;l&#195;&#170;mwa, Martuthunira, Wandala, Northeast Ambae (Aikhenvald and Dixon 2012:7), some Nilotic languages, Hausa, Wolof, and in Semitic languages as part of the `construct state&#39; (Creissels 2009).
&lt;br/&gt;
	We follow Creissels (2009) in not classifying possessed marking as a noun case. However, departing from Creissels (2009), the label PSSD is adopted because it is specifically the quality of marking a noun as possessed that must be incorporated into the schema, not the formal property of being part of a construct-state-like construction for which Creissel&#39;s label, CSTR, would be better suited.

Moreover, the semantics of the distal/remote and proximate morphemes are the same for local cases and for demonstratives. Distal local case and remoteness on pronouns both indicate that the thing involved is distant from the speaker while proximate morphemes in both categories indicate the opposite.

In these languages, no more than two sets of SR markers exist, given the description in Stirling (1993:16), and all use one set for adverbials (as well as complement and relative clause constructions in Choctaw and Chickasaw) and one set for another function, such as paratactic clause combinations (Choctaw and Chickasaw), relative clauses (Hopi), and subjunctive contexts (Imbabura Quichua).

	In English, examples of masdars include some `gerundive&#39; forms ending in -ing, such as running in the running of the race happened quickly. These are also action nominals, which are taken to be the default interpretation of a masdar. (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.38f.)</rdfs:comment>

            >In some languages, a fourth person category is used to describe an otherwise third-person referent that is differentiated from other third-person referents by a switch-reference-like distinction (e.g. fourth person for a same-subject [SS] verb form in Central Yup&#39;ik [Woodbury 1982] or for &quot;disjoint reference across clauses&quot; in Navajo [Willie 1991:108]) or, more commonly, by a distinction in obviation status (Chelliah and de Reuse 2011:306-307), as in Keres (isolate; New Mexico, USA), in which &quot;[f]ourth person is used [...] when the subject of the action is inferior to the object, as when an animal is the subject and a human being the object&quot; (Davis 1964:76). For the purposes of morphological distinctions, these fourth person categories may call for dedicated verbal morphology. While in some cases their meaning can be captured by third person (3) plus switch-reference features or features marking pragmatic voice distinctions (such as the proximate (PRX) and obviative (OBV)), we include a fourth person category with the feature 4 to allow for identification of a fourth person category when the semantic distinctions are complicated or not strictly inflectional in nature.
