<br/>
The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world's languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The specification of the schema is described here and in Sylak-Glassman (2016). (http://unimorph.org)
<br/>
Unless marked otherwise, all comments are drawn from Sylak-Glassman (2016). At present, the UniMorph Schema accounts for inflectional morphology only, not derivational morphology.
<br/>
The UniMorph Schema is intended to capture the full range of meaning that can be expressed by inflectional morphology across the world's languages. As instantiated in this document, the schema contains 23 dimensions of meaning and over 240 features. The UniMorph Schema provides a way to annotate very rich, fine-grained representations of the meaning encoded in fully inflected word forms, thereby allowing HLT applications to extract meaning from inflectional morphology across languages with strong confidence that the inflectional categories are semantically equivalent. ... The UniMorph Schema is designed to achieve extremely broad cross-linguistic coverage, and has proven useful in universalizing inflected forms in over 350 languages on Wiktionary (Sylak-Glassman et al. 2015b,a). However, it is a work-in-progress, and would benefit from user input, especially in case any other dimensions or features should be included. (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.58f.)

In particular, argumentative sections have been removed, as well as many examples and diagrams. The latter, however, are partially encoded in the structure of the ontology. Due to limitations of UTF-8 export from PDF documents, examples with non-ASCII characters had to be removed. For cyrillic, the original (cyrillic) spelling has been partially restored.
<br/>
Also note that I followed Sylak-Glassman in modeling features as individuals (primitive values) rather than classes wherever possible. However, where he describes a hierarchical organization (e.g., animacy, aktionsart) or mentions that one feature is a specialization of another (e.g., aspect), classes were created to capture these definitions.
<br/>
Wrt. naming conventions for classes, the original names have been adopted wherever possible. If a concept name X cannot be easily used in a phrase like "x is a X" without causing confusion, it has been adjusted to XFeature. For example, "Deixis" and "Reference Point" have been renamed to "DeixisFeature" and "ReferencePointFeature", because "proximate is a Deixis" or "phoric is a Reference" would be unnatural.

Familiar European languages are dependent-marking in that nominal case is marked on the noun itself. However, languages such as Abkhaz (Chirikba 2003) and Choctaw (Davies 1986) are head-marking, and can mark four or five distinct nominal arguments, respectively, on a verb. For example, Abkhaz can mark a subject (ergative), object (absolutive), indirect dative object, and indirect beneficiary object simultaneously on a single verb ...
<br/>
	Following Kibrik (2012), the arguments marked by a verb are labeled here using case terminology, rather than, for example, grammatical terminology such as "subject, direct object, indirect object." This is especially appropriate given that head-marking languages can also show patterns similar to so-called `quirky case' in which verbs, especially psych verbs, trigger agreement patterns in which the subject is not marked in the same way as subjects for other verbs. This shows that purely formal considerations also shape the pattern, rather than just grammatical or even semantic relations, even though these also play a role. ...

	To capture arguments marked on the verb in head-marking languages, the UniMorph Schema employs templatic features which all begin with arg-, to signify that a verb is marking an argument, and continue with shorthand features for case, person, number, and gender.

The types of core cases vary according to the syntactic alignment that a given language uses and can be defined in terms of three "metaarguments," S, A, and P.

	S is the subject of an intransitive (1-argument) verb.
	A is the subject of a transitive (2-argument) or ditransitive (3-argument) verb.
	P is the direct object of a transitive or ditransitive verb.

	S, A, and P are all abbreviations from the first letters of the terms `subject,' `agent,' and `patient,' respectively. Indirect objects are commonly marked with the dative case and are typically not considered core arguments.

	The ways in which languages map morphological cases to the meta-arguments S, A, and P are collectively called syntactic alignment systems.

	In a language with nominative-accusative alignment, the nominative case is used for nouns that function as S or A and accusative is used for nouns that function as P (Blake 2001:119-121).

	In an ergative-absolutive language, the ergative case is used for nouns that function as A only while absolutive case is used to mark nouns that function as S or P (122-125).

	A few languages have been claimed to possess a full, tripartite distinction between S, A, and P. These languages include Wangkumara (Breen 1976 via Blake 2001:126; Pama-Nyungan) and Yazgulyam (Edel'man 1966:37, 167, 185, Payne 1981:176 via Bickel and Nichols 2009; Pamir, Indo-Iranian).

	Another kind of syntactic alignment, which cannot be described solely in terms of S, A, and P, is the direct-inverse system, which is described under the section on grammatical voice systems in Sylak-Glasman 2016, p. 56. These kinds of systems, which occur for example in Plains Cree, can overtly mark direct and inverse "case" on a noun. Nouns are also sometimes marked as `antipassive' (ANTIP).

<br/>
	The referent of pronouns is dependent on the context of the utterance, as is the referent of words like here, this, that, these, those. This quality of context-dependency is called deixis, and words are sometimes systematically contrasted in terms of their deictic properties.
<br/>
	Demonstrative pronouns are deictic words which encode a variety of distinctions in meaning that specify the relationship between the speaker or addressee and the person or thing referred to by the pronoun, and these distinctions are relevant for determining the referent of the demonstrative.
	For example, the difference between `this' and `that' in English can be understood as a distinction in distance. ("Distance" here should be understood in a very broad sense, since the English demonstratives `this' and `that' can be used to express spatial, temporal, or even psychological/social distance.)

"Run" is therefore durative because its action can extend over a time span. "Sneeze" is punctual because, lexically, it has no duration: It is a single event that takes place for an instant and the action cannot be understood as extending over a time span.

            rdfs:comment """Despite the diffculty of defining finiteness in a universal way along semantic or syntactic lines, the notion of finiteness remains cross-linguistically useful and is crucial for differentiating infinitives from other verb forms. For the purpose of this schema, verb forms that take the full extent of tense, aspect, and mood (TAM) marking in a language that can be used as predicates can be considered finite, while verbally-derived parts of speech such as masdars (verbal nouns), participles (verbal adjectives), and converbs (verbal adverbs) are considered nonfinite (Haspelmath 1995:4-7). The finiteness feature in the schema presented here is therefore partially redundant with the part of speech features: Masdars, participles, and converbs are always nonfinite while plain verbs may be finite or nonfinite. An example of a plain verb with the feature nonfinite (NFIN) is the infinitive in languages such as Spanish, Russian, and English.
<br/>
	Although Koptjevskaja-Tamm (1993:29) echoes the opinion of Haspelmath (1995:5) and other linguists in writing that "[t]he notion of finiteness is far from being well-defined," it is nevertheless a valuable means of distinguishing a small set of cross-linguistically common verb forms with recurring characteristics. One view is that a verbal form is finite if it takes a subject in nominative, ergative, or absolutive case and if it can take on inflectional features, such as number and gender, based on another syntactic argument (subject or object; Cowper 2002). Another view is that finite verb forms are those which can function as the predicate of independent clauses while nonfinite verb forms are always (morpho-)syntactically dependent (Koptjevskaja-Tamm 1993:29). The notion of finiteness appears to be best viewed as a language-specific constellation of syntactic properties.

        rdfs:comment """Gender is a grammatical category that includes both gender, as conventionally known from European languages like Spanish, French, German, and Russian, as well as systems with more than three categories that are typically described as noun class systems. These include systems like that of the Nakh-Daghestanian languages of the Northeast Caucasus with two to eight gender categories, as well as more extensive systems, such as those of the Bantu languages, which can include up to around twenty distinct categories (Corbett 1991:24, 43-44).
<br/>
	Gender systems can be organized according to either natural gender (biological sex), formal gender, or a mix (Corbett 1991:1). Natural gender systems classify nouns according to transparent semantic criteria. In formal gender systems, however, there need not be any correlation between the gender category of a noun and any of the properties of the entity to which the noun refers. Gender in these systems may either be based on phonological properties or else is an unpredictable lexical property that must be memorized.
<br/>
	Within language families, gender categories and their assignment to nouns can overlap among languages enough to render the equation of gender categories appropriate. The gender features of this schema are therefore often tied to particular language families. This ensures that gender features have some generality, and do not proliferate as language-specific features. For example, the eight possible genders (or noun classes) of the Nakh-Daghestanian languages are labeled as NAKH1, NAKH2, NAKH3, NAKH4, and so on for languages like Tsova-Tush (Corbett 1991:24). Similarly, the Bantu noun classes are symbolized as BANTU1-23, which encompasses the whole range of noun classes that could have been inherited in any given Bantu language from proto-Bantu (Demuth 2000:270-272).
<br/>
	Other gender systems from other language families can be incorporated on this same model, with features of a similar format, namely a short abbreviation for the language family followed by the term used for the specific gender. The schema includes features for the masculine, feminine, and neuter distinction common in Indo-European languages.

The genitive case is also used in some languages to cover the uses of the partitive case (PRT), which marks the patient (P) of a verb as being only partly affected by the verb's action (e.g. some milk [but not all] in he drank some milk). The partitive case occurs as an independent case in Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, where it "is used for the patient if it represents part of a whole or an indefinite quantity, if the action is incomplete, or if the polarity of the clause is negative". These uses of the partitive are captured by the genitive case in both Russian and French. Russian's "genitive of negation" (e.g. Russian njet molok-a `no milk-GEN') can also be thought of as connected to the senses of meanings conveyed using the partitive.

More concretely, information structure directly encodes which parts of a proposition are presented as new information for the addressee and which are not (5-6). (Lambrecht (1994:5) formally defines information structure as the "component of sentence grammar in which propositions as conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts.")

	Languages may distinguish the topic (TOP) and the focus (FOC) of a sentence through overt morphology. The topic can broadly be seen as signaling what the sentence is about. Lambrecht (1994:131) defines the topic more specifically as "expressing information which is relevant to [a referent in the proposition] and which increases the addressee's knowledge of this referent." The focus can broadly be understood as signaling information that is not presupposed by the addressee (213). This information forms the core of the proposition's assertion, and typically includes the part of the proposition that is unpredictable or new to the listener (ibid.). Lambrecht (1994:213) formally defines focus as "[t]he semantic component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition."

	While most studies on information structure distinguish multiple types of topic and focus (including Lambrecht 1994) that can be distinguished via prosody or syntax, no language appears to make distinctions via overt affixal morphology to a finer degree than topic vs. focus vs. unmarked. Lambrecht (1994:119) explains the lack of any formal topic marking in many languages, or of more fine-grained topic marking in languages which do formally mark it, as a result of the difficulty of strictly limiting the topic to any particular element in a proposition.

	Huallaga Quechua marks possession through overt affixal morphology that distinguishes the possessor's person and clusivity, yielding distinctions between morphemes with the meaning my, your, his/her/its, our (inclusive) and our (exclusive) (Weber 1989:54-55). ... Turkish marks possession in a similar way, distinguishing the possessor's person, number (for first and second person), and politeness, but not clusivity as in Quechua. ... Like Turkish and Huallaga Quechua, Arabic distinguishes possessive suffixes by the person and number of the possessor, but adds dual to the number distinctions made among possessors. Arabic possessive suffixes are also distinguished by the gender of the possessor (Ryding 2005:301). ...
<br/>
	Features that mark characteristics of the possessor are composed according to a template, which begins with pss- to mark `possessed,' followed by a single number to mark the person of the possessor, a single letter to mark the number of the possessor, and an indication of gender, clusivity, or politeness. If a language were to mark possession by, for example, another kind of gender other than masculine or feminine (e.g. neuter), features could easily be created using this template (e.g. in this case, PSS3SN for a third person singular neuter possessive with the meaning of English its).
<br/>
	In addition to features marking characteristics of the possessor, features indicating the type of possession itself are necessary. Some languages distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession. An example of this contrast is the difference in the type of possession involved in `my house' vs. `my back,' in which the first type of possession is possession of property whose ownership can change while the second indicates inherent ownership.

	Pragmatic voice systems include what have been called direct-inverse systems, which are common in North American languages, as well as complex voicing systems in Austronesian languages (so-called `Austronesian voice'). In languages that possess direct-inverse systems, a salience hierarchy exists such that, as a hypothetical example, first person is higher (more "salient") than second person, which is higher than third person, and all these human pronouns are higher than any non-human animate nouns (or pronouns referring to them), and all these in turn are higher than inanimate nouns or pronouns, yielding the hierarchy: 1 > 2 > 3 > non-human animate > inanimate. When the argument of the verb that is the most `salient' in the sentence functions as the subject, the verb is either morphologically unmarked or is marked with a morpheme indicating direct voice (e.g. -a: in Plains Cree; Klaiman 1992:230). When the argument of the verb that is lower in the hierarchy functions as the subject, it is marked with a morpheme indicating inverse voice (e.g. -iko in Plains Cree; ibid.).

	In general, pragmatic voice marking affects the prominence of nominals associated with specific semantic roles or with positions on a salience hierarchy. One striking example of this is the alignment system commonly found in Austronesian languages, particularly those of the Philippines, such as Tagalog, Cebuano, and Ilocano. In the pragmatic voice system of Cebuano, a different voice is used to focus nouns occupying four semantic roles, agent (A), goal (G), directional (D), and instrumental (I) (Klaiman 1991:247). ...

	Here, a voice marker that is tied to the semantic role of the focused noun is used on the verb and the overt marker of the semantic role on the focused noun is replaced by a marker that indicates both its semantic role and its status as focused. The Austronesian language that makes the most distinctions in semantic role marking in its voice system is Iloko (Ilocano). The semantic roles it marks are given dedicated features in the UniMorph Schema since they are used by other Austronesian languages. Those roles are: Agent (AGFOC), patient (PFOC), location (LFOC), beneficiary (BFOC), accompanier (ACFOC), instrument (IFOC), and conveyed (CFOC; either by actual motion or in a linguistic sense, as by a speech act) (Rubino 2005:336-338).

are not small points in time where the action of running has ceased. However, if one says that someone sneezed for an hour, the interpretation is that multiple events necessarily had to occur, and that there were small breaks between those events in which the event was not occurring. "Run" is therefore durative because its action can extend over a time span. "Sneeze" is punctual because, lexically, it has no duration: It is a single event that takes place for an instant and the action cannot be understood as extending over a time span. Forcibly extending a punctual action over a time span, for example by specifically stating a duration, forces a repetitive interpretation.

<br/>
	Tense is the relationship of the time of utterance (TU) to the topic time (TT). For example, in the sentence, "The book was lying on the table," the speaker is making a claim about a time period (TT) that occurred prior to the time of utterance (TU). Past tense indicates that the time for which the claim is meant to be true, TT, occurred before TU. Present tense indicates that the situation holds true during the time of utterance. Future tense indicates that at some point after the time of utterance, a situation will hold true. ...

	Although past, present, and future are the core tense relationships that can be establishing by the relative positioning of TU and TT, languages use morphological marking to indicate the temporal distance between TU and TT, leading to distinctions like recent vs. remote past. A survey of such systems in Comrie (1985) reveals that while the most common split is a two-way split in the past tense between events that happened on the same day (hodiernal, from Latin hodie `today'; 87) from those that did not, languages can make up to six such temporal distinctions. ... Because the levels of temporal distance can be symmetrical, terms for these levels are meant to apply to both past and future, such that a hodiernal past would be indicated as PST+HOD and a future hodiernal would be FUT+HOD. These are preliminary categories since it may be better to encode some of the temporal distinctions using a feature-like analysis. For example, it may be possible to encode some of the finer distinctions in Upper Chinookan with combinations of temporal distance features. Preliminarily, I propose that Upper Chinookan's `last week' distinction could be PST+1DAY+RCT while `from a week to a year ago' would be simply PST+RCT and similarly the `from 1-10 years ago' level may be PST+RCT+RMT while the truly remote past would be simply PST+RMT.

<br/>
	Verbs can also form the basis for productively deriving three parts of speech, namely participles, masdars, and converbs, that each behave similarly to adjectives, nouns, and adverbs, respectively. While these three parts of speech could be subsumed within the part of speech that they behave as (i.e. adjectives, nominals, and adverbs), the fact that they are derived from verbs typically entails other syntactic properties or restrictions that do not apply to non-derived exemplars of the part of speech they behave as. For example, these derived forms are often still able to govern nouns as direct objects (...), and these properties motivate treating them as a class distinct from both the part of speech from which they are derived (verbs) and those which they resemble most strongly from a functional perspective.

Another system that has expanded switch-reference due to indexing subjects with non-subject NPs is attested in Warlpiri (Pama-Nyungan). Warlpiri has 4 overt SR markers that relate subjects to subjects, subjects to direct objects, and subjects to indirect objects (Stirling 1993:25). ...

	To capture systems like those in Warlpiri and Capanahua, it is necessary to have a schematic morpheme that relates the role of the NP in the controlling clause to that of the NP in the marked clause. This takes the form ControllingClauseNP_Relation_MarkedClauseNP (abbreviated CN_R_MN), where the roles of the NPs would be marked using case relations, such that same subject in a nominative-accusative language would be CNOM_S_MNOM, where S in the R slot stands for `same.'

	Related to imperative-jussives are prohibitives.

Here, the marking occurs on a noun rather than a verb, which is part of the reason these systems have not traditionally been considered switch-reference. This may be a trivial distinction, but other considerations favor treating logophoricity and switch-reference as separate phenomena. Languages that are logophoric often have syntactic and semantic restrictions on where logophoricity must be marked, e.g. in subordinate clauses which represent reported speech or are governed by the verb "say" (Stirling 1993:52-53). The obligatoriness of marking logophoricity also depends on person (53). In addition, there are unexpected co-reference patterns (ibid.). These can be seen in Gokana, which marks logophoricity on the verb and has thus been interpreted as a switch-reference language. ... Because these interpretations (especially 2.) are not expected in the case of standard same subject SR marking, logophoricity should be marked separately from standard same subject SR marking.

	We follow Creissels (2009) in not classifying possessed marking as a noun case. However, departing from Creissels (2009), the label PSSD is adopted because it is specifically the quality of marking a noun as possessed that must be incorporated into the schema, not the formal property of being part of a construct-state-like construction for which Creissel's label, CSTR, would be better suited.

In Russian, for example, the present active participle has adjectival inflection and agrees in number, gender, and case with the noun that it modifies. For example, the participial form читающий "reading" is derived from the verb читат�?ь "to read (IMPERFECTIVE)" and can be seen to agree in number, gender, and case in the following example.

	(32) Девушк-а, читающа�? доклад, не ответи-л-а
	     girl-F.NOM.SG readingV.PTCP-NOM.F.SG report.M NEG answer-PST-F.SG
	     `The girl, reading the report, did non answer.'

	The participle in this example retains verbal characteristics since it governs a noun (доклад `report') as a direct object. However, the participle behaves like an adjective in that it bears agreement features from the subject, девушка `the girl.'

              rdfs:comment "In some languages, a fourth person category is used to describe an otherwise third-person referent that is differentiated from other third-person referents by a switch-reference-like distinction (e.g. fourth person for a same-subject [SS] verb form in Central Yup'ik [Woodbury 1982] or for "disjoint reference across clauses" in Navajo [Willie 1991:108]) or, more commonly, by a distinction in obviation status (Chelliah and de Reuse 2011:306-307), as in Keres (isolate; New Mexico, USA), in which "[f]ourth person is used [...] when the subject of the action is inferior to the object, as when an animal is the subject and a human being the object" (Davis 1964:76). For the purposes of morphological distinctions, these fourth person categories may call for dedicated verbal morphology. While in some cases their meaning can be captured by third person (3) plus switch-reference features or features marking pragmatic voice distinctions (such as the proximate (PRX) and obviative (OBV)), we include a fourth person category with the feature 4 to allow for identification of a fourth person category when the semantic distinctions are complicated or not strictly inflectional in nature.
