<span class='annotation-uri'>comment:</span> <span class='literal'>"Information structure is a component of grammar that formally expresses "the pragmatic structuring of a proposition in a discourse" (Lambrecht 1994:5). More concretely, information structure directly encodes which parts of a proposition are presented as new information for the addressee and which are not (5-6). (Lambrecht (1994:5) formally defines information structure as the "component of sentence grammar in which propositions as conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts.")
	
	Languages may distinguish the topic (TOP) and the focus (FOC) of a sentence through overt morphology. The topic can broadly be seen as signaling what the sentence is about. Lambrecht (1994:131) defines the topic more specifically as "expressing information which is relevant to [a referent in the proposition] and which increases the addressee's knowledge of this referent." The focus can broadly be understood as signaling information that is not presupposed by the addressee (213). This information forms the core of the proposition's assertion, and typically includes the part of the proposition that is unpredictable or new to the listener (ibid.). Lambrecht (1994:213) formally defines focus as "[t]he semantic component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs from the presupposition."
	
	While most studies on information structure distinguish multiple types of topic and focus (including Lambrecht 1994) that can be distinguished via prosody or syntax, no language appears to make distinctions via overt affixal morphology to a finer degree than topic vs. focus vs. unmarked. Lambrecht (1994:119) explains the lack of any formal topic marking in many languages, or of more fine-grained topic marking in languages which do formally mark it, as a result of the difficulty of strictly limiting the topic to any particular element in a proposition.
