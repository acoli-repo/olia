<span class='annotation-uri'>versionInfo:</span> <span class='literal'>"Note that descriptions are not necessarily literal quotes from Sylak-Glasman, but have been partially simplified and abbreviated. In particular, argumentative sections have been removed, as well as many examples and diagrams. The latter, however, are partially encoded in the structure of the ontology. Due to limitations of UTF-8 export from PDF documents, examples with non-ASCII characters had to be removed. For cyrillic, the original (cyrillic) spelling has been partially restored. 
<br/>
Also note that I followed Sylak-Glassman in modeling features as individuals (primitive values) rather than classes wherever possible. However, where he describes a hierarchical organization (e.g., animacy, aktionsart) or mentions that one feature is a specialization of another (e.g., aspect), classes were created to capture these definitions.
<br/>
Wrt. naming conventions for classes, the original names have been adopted wherever possible. If a concept name X cannot be easily used in a phrase like "x is a X" without causing confusion, it has been adjusted to XFeature. For example, "Deixis" and "Reference Point" have been renamed to "DeixisFeature" and "ReferencePointFeature", because "proximate is a Deixis" or "phoric is a Reference" would be unnatural.
<br/>
Note that bibliographic references have been preserved, but not the bibliography that must be retrieved from Sylak-Glassman (2016).

<span class='annotation-uri'>comment:</span> <span class='literal'>"Annotation Model for the Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project
<br/>
The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world's languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The specification of the schema is described here and in Sylak-Glassman (2016). (http://unimorph.org)
<br/>
Unless marked otherwise, all comments are drawn from Sylak-Glassman (2016). At present, the UniMorph Schema accounts for inflectional morphology only, not derivational morphology.
<br/>
The UniMorph Schema is intended to capture the full range of meaning that can be expressed by inflectional morphology across the world's languages. As instantiated in this document, the schema contains 23 dimensions of meaning and over 240 features. The UniMorph Schema provides a way to annotate very rich, fine-grained representations of the meaning encoded in fully inflected word forms, thereby allowing HLT applications to extract meaning from inflectional morphology across languages with strong confidence that the inflectional categories are semantically equivalent. ... The UniMorph Schema is designed to achieve extremely broad cross-linguistic coverage, and has proven useful in universalizing inflected forms in over 350 languages on Wiktionary (Sylak-Glassman et al. 2015b,a). However, it is a work-in-progress, and would benefit from user input, especially in case any other dimensions or features should be included. (Sylak-Glassman 2016, p.58f.)
