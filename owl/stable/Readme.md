# OLiA ontologies

The OLiA ontologies are accessible as follows:
- [olia/owl/core](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia/tree/master/owl/stable) OLiA core vocabulary, e.g., `olia.owl`. Applications should address these via resolvable Purl URIs, e.g., `http://purl.org/olia/olia.owl` (no `core/`!).
- [olia/owl/stable](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia/tree/master/owl/stable) stable annotation models, e.g., `penn.owl`. Applications should address these via resolvable Purl URIs, e.g., `http://purl.org/olia/penn.owl` (no `stable/` !).
- [olia/owl/experimental](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia/tree/master/owl/experimental) experimental annotation models, e.g., [`discourse/olia_discourse.owl`}(https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia/blob/master/owl/experimental/discourse/olia_discourse.owl). Note that only some of these files provide persistent and/or resolvable URIs, see the files directly for their URI schema.
